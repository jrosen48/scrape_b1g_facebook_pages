172636137574_10155558199817575,"Dear Rutgers Students,
 
Respectful dialogue is at the heart of everything we do at Rutgers; indeed, it makes us great. Our right to free expression is weighty, it carries with it tremendous power and enormous responsibility.
 
A community as diverse as ours holds many different views – and we value them all.  We celebrate our diverse racial, ethnic, and economic profile, and we embrace our political diversity.  Just like we encourage students to reach out to understand people of other races, ethnicities, genders, or cultures, so, too, must we encourage understanding among students of differing political beliefs.
 
As President, I want to emphasize that Rutgers University stands together with all our students.  No matter your political view, ethnicity, religious beliefs, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, or nationality, you are first and foremost a Rutgers student, and you are owed our respect, our support, and our best efforts to keep you safe and secure as you express your opinions and pursue your studies.
 
Our University is and must be a safe place for all people to live and learn – where students and others of all viewpoints may express their ideas with the full expectation that they will be heard and respected.   Robust exchanges may not always be comfortable, but they must always be respectful.
 
We encourage those discussions.  They make us stronger and more resilient.  But please know that we expect those discussions to be civil; we will not tolerate hate speech, threats of physical harm or intimidation by anyone on any side of any discussion on our campuses.
 
Our chancellors have been providing opportunities for students to express themselves, to share their concerns publicly and to speak privately with professionals to answer personal or legal concerns that they may have.  Students who feel anxious or upset may always seek assistance from counseling professionals at the student health services locations in Camden, Newark, and New Brunswick.  The Rutgers Law School operates an Immigrant Rights Clinic (located at the Center for Law and Justice, room 402A, in Newark; 973-353-5292) which can confidentially answer questions regarding immigration law or other concerns of undocumented students.
 
Over the past few days, many students have raised concerns about their privacy and their safety. You should know that:
 
We will protect student confidentiality and will not share private information unless required by law or a court order. We expect all persons associated with the University to protect student privacy and confidentiality, as well.
 
Rutgers police do not inquire into nor record the immigration status of students or other persons unless a serious crime has been committed.
 
Rutgers University does not use E-verify for any purposes other than to comply with longstanding federal law regarding employment eligibility.  Immigration status is not a factor in student housing decisions.
 
Finally, you should be aware that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy characterizes colleges and universities, like Rutgers, as ""sensitive locations,"" places where, in the normal course, enforcement actions should not occur unless extraordinary circumstances exist.
 
We cherish and will protect the rights of free expression and privacy that are afforded to all members of the Rutgers community.  We will do everything in our power to protect the safety of our students and community.  We embrace the passion and commitment to civic engagement that have defined Rutgers for 250 years. Let us set an example for the country that shows how real freedom of expression can be exercised in a safe and respectful manner.
 
Sincerely,
 
Robert Barchi",,status,,2016-11-15 16:44:19,650,133,121,573,66,0,4,0,7

172636137574_10155524592832575,"Attention Rutgers Community:
 
The Rutgers University Police Department issued a crime alert on November 4, 2016, detailing an aggravated assault which was reported to have occurred on November 4, 2016 at approximately 2:30 PM at the Rutgers Business School located at 100 Rockafeller Road in Piscataway.
 
The suspect in this incident is identified as Joshua S. Thompson, a 25 year old resident of Mountainside, New Jersey.  Thompson is currently in custody and has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, possession of a weapon (knives) for an unlawful purpose, and unlawful possession of a weapon (knives).
 
The Rutgers University Police Department continues to actively investigate this incident and asks that anyone with information, or who may have been in the area at the time, contact the Rutgers Police Department Detective Bureau at (848) 932-8025. 
 
The Rutgers University Police Department reminds you that you can reduce your chances of being a crime victim by taking reasonable precautions, including:
 
• Immediately report suspicious activity to local law enforcement;
• Remaining alert and aware of the people and circumstances around you;
• Avoid isolated or dark areas; 
• Walking in groups when traveling during late night hours.
 
The Rutgers University Police Department provides escorts to students, faculty, and staff upon request. The escorts provide our community with personalized service to their vehicles, campus residence, or the University's mass transit system.  In order to request a security escort we ask that an individual contact the police communications center at 732-932-7211.

172636137574_10155514167457575,"UPDATE:
Members of the Rutgers Community:
I am writing to provide notification of a stabbing incident that occurred at the Rutgers Business School in Piscataway this afternoon.  The incident involved two members of our campus community and a former student.  The suspect was taken into custody, and all three individuals were transported to a local hospital for treatment of their injuries.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.
Please know that the safety and security of the Rutgers community is a paramount concern.  The Rutgers University Police Department, which was quickly on the scene, issued a text alert to the Rutgers–New Brunswick community when the incident occurred and a second alert when the suspect was taken into custody and there was no longer any danger to the community.  In addition, the Division of Student Affairs made grief counseling available on scene shortly after the event.  The Division will continue to make counseling and support services available to students, faculty and staff affected by today's events.
While this act was an isolated incident, we understand the concerns that members of our University community may have, and we will provide additional information as it becomes available.
The RUPD will send a message to the Rutgers–New Brunswick community regarding this incident in keeping with the Clery Act.
Thank you for your continued support and assistance, and I look forward to our working together to keep Rutgers a safe, vibrant, and secure learning community.

For some of you, because yesterday was the final day to add a course without special permission from departments or instructors, you may have been waiting to make your final decision about courses on those campuses until attending that Wednesday class session.
 
Therefore, for courses that have a Wednesday meeting on Cook or Douglass, you will be permitted to add the course by end-of-business Monday, September 19, if: a) the course is not closed; and b) you have the necessary prerequisites or other criteria making you eligible to enroll in the course. 
 
Naturally, as with any course you add after the semester begins, you are responsible for completing all course requirements, tests, and assignments. Because this is a targeted solution necessitated by extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to use WebReg to add the course. Rather, you should contact your dean's office or the Registrar's Office directly regarding this matter, after you have received a special permission number from your instructor or the department that offers the class.
 
​Best wishes for a successful semester.
 
Sincerely,

172636137574_10155130599472575,"Patrol Officers from the Rutgers University Police Department (RUPD) assigned throughout the Rutgers University system will soon be outfitted with ""body cameras"" worn on the front of their uniform.  The rollout will begin with fourteen(14) patrol officers this week and it is anticipated that all patrol personnel will be equipped with the devices by the beginning of the academic year in September 2016.
 
RUPD patrol vehicles have been equipped with dashboard cameras since 2001. Body-worn cameras add a layer of accountability for the police and the public in that they will document what occurred during a call for service, as well as assist officers in the collection of evidence and aid in investigations. 
 
Once the program is fully implemented, officers assigned to patrol will wear their body cameras and turn them on when interacting with the public during a dispatched or self-initiated service call.  Additionally, RUPD supervisors will be able to review the videos captured by the body cameras to assess how officers interact with citizens and, if necessary, tailor department training programs to improve how those officers work in the field.  This technology will also capture the positive work our officers are already doing in the field.
 
Funding for the cameras came in part from the Body-Worn Camera Assistance Program offered through the New Jersey Attorney General's Office.",,status,,2016-07-19 08:27:02,303,7,57,289,14,0,0,0,0

For non-ticket holders:  The University wants to ensure that everyone in the Rutgers community, including staff and faculty members, current students and alumni, and the families and friends of the graduating students, will be able to watch the ceremony as it unfolds.
 
On the Web:  First and foremost, we encourage you to see the event, live and in its entirety, via a link from our Commencement website.  The ceremony will start at 12:30 p.m.  Visit the University Commencement website on Sunday to access the link at http://commencement.rutgers.edu.

TV Coverage:  We anticipate that President Obama's commencement speech may be shown live on local television stations; check the Commencement website for details.  For those on campus that day, the entire ceremony will be on RU-tv, channel 25-2. For those who have a cable package that includes the Big Ten Network, please note that BTN plans to carry the commencement speech live on BTN2Go and via the BTN2Go app (subscription to BTN required).  BTN will also televise the President's speech Sunday evening at 10:30 pm EDT.  
 
Viewing Sites:  We have set up numerous viewing sites in student centers, academic buildings, and other venues across the Busch, Livingston, and College Avenue campuses at Rutgers–New Brunswick, where the ceremony will be streamed.  This may be an option for family and friends of the graduates who are on campus but do not have a ticket to the University Commencement, especially those who will be attending the SAS or Engineering convocations later that afternoon.  A full list of these sites—plus viewing sites at Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden—is posted at http://commencement.rutgers.edu/indoor-and-site-viewing-options.
 
The coming week will be filled with convocations and commencement ceremonies that salute the Class of 2016 and celebrate our highest values.

Thank you to all of you who have registered for field and guest tickets for the May 15 University Commencement at High Point Solutions Stadium.  We are grateful for your patience over the past week as we dealt with the high volume of requests.  We are still completing the ticketing process for students who were unable to register online successfully. Tickets and parking hangtags are being mailed to all registered graduating students over the next several days.

We will next conduct a lottery for those tickets that still remain after the initial registration period.  On Monday, May 9, the University will choose names at random from the pool of all Rutgers–New Brunswick and RBHS students who registered for tickets, and the Athletics ticket office will notify those randomly selected individuals that they are eligible for one additional ticket.  Selected students will be asked to e-mail commencement@rutgers.edu with their guest name and will be sent a barcoded guest ticket.  These lottery-selected tickets will be sent by e-mail and must be printed by the student.  Please note that guest tickets distributed through the lottery will be for individual seats in various sections of the stadium and will not be adjacent to a student's other guest tickets. 

Please continue to consult http://commencement.rutgers.edu for information about our ongoing planning for Commencement and about all the Rutgers–New Brunswick and RBHS convocations.

172636137574_10154899866522575,"COMMENCEMENT UPDATE:

Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students of Rutgers–New Brunswick and RBHS:

While graduating students have already received some information regarding tickets for the 250th Anniversary University Commencement ceremony on May 15 at High Point Solutions Stadium, this message is intended to provide the broader Rutgers community with a general update about our preparations for this historic event.

The University has been in regular communication with the White House about President Obama's participation in the ceremony, and while some logistical decisions will be made in the week immediately prior to May 15, we have gained clarity on several important matters.

Student Ticketing: Our first focus has been on accommodating the graduating students from Rutgers University–New Brunswick and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences.  Because of the unprecedented number of New Brunswick and RBHS graduating students who have registered for University Commencement, we are utilizing a ticketing system and have limited the number of tickets to three guest tickets and one field ticket, plus one parking hangtag, for each of these students.  This limitation has understandably disappointed many students and their families, but there was no solution that would have enabled us to increase the per-student allotment for this many graduating students.  It is important to note that no tickets are required for the School of Arts and Sciences Convocation, which is the ceremony following University Commencement and in which SAS graduates will be individually recognized.

As you may know, all Rutgers University–Newark and Rutgers University–Camden graduating students, who will also be participating in their own universities' and schools' commencement exercises that week, have been offered the opportunity to attend the May 15 ceremony without guests.  These students will not be given parking hangtags and must travel to New Brunswick by way of a special charter train leaving from Trenton and later from Newark Penn Station that morning.  Please note that even if we did not make this decision, there are not enough seats in the stadium for us to be able to increase the per-student ticket allotment for New Brunswick and RBHS graduates.

All graduating students have been directed to a ticketing website and instructed that they must register for their ticket or tickets by Wednesday, May 4 or lose the opportunity to obtain tickets.  If we find that any tickets remain after this firm deadline, the University will make a decision about how to make those tickets available to registered New Brunswick and RBHS graduating students on a lottery basis.

As there will be increased security at High Point Solutions Stadium because of President Obama's participation, no bags will be allowed in the stadium for University Commencement.

SAS Convocation Time Change: As you may know, the School of Arts and Sciences Convocation, with broadcast journalist Bill Moyers as keynote speaker, takes place in the stadium following the conclusion of University Commencement.  The SAS Convocation start time has been moved to 3:00 p.m. in order to provide time for non-SAS graduates and their guests to exit the stadium and to allow any additional guests of SAS graduating students to enter the stadium for the convocation.  This is an open ceremony; as noted earlier, tickets are not required for guests coming in the afternoon to attend the SAS Convocation.

Faculty:  Faculty presence at University Convocation in their academic regalia has always been a vital part of the ceremony.  This year, because of seating limitations at the stadium and our focus on accommodating the graduating students as much as possible, we must limit the total seating for New Brunswick and RBHS faculty members to 1,200 seats.  We will be working on the allocation of tickets for faculty, and we will communicate further with faculty in the coming days about this matter.

Staff and Alumni: Unfortunately, we will not be able to accommodate staff employees or alumni at the stadium other than those who are working at the event or have previously registered with the Office of the Secretary to serve as Commencement volunteers.  Please note that volunteer registration is closed.

Other Viewing Options: Viewing sites will be set up with live streaming of University Commencement in locations around the New Brunswick Campus, including the Livingston, Busch, and College Avenue Student Centers. (No tickets are needed at these Iocations.)  In addition, the ceremony will be streamed live on the University Commencement website at http://commencement.rutgers.edu.

Changes to traffic patterns and gate opening times as well as security notices and other updates are anticipated.

Members of the Rutgers Community:

First of all, I want to thank you for your patience and cooperation during today's network difficulties caused by a DDoS attack. I know that it was frustrating to have limited, if any, access to the Internet for several hours during the work or school day. At this time, network connectivity has been stabilized and remains under observation and monitoring, but some services may still experience intermittent degradation throughout the evening.

You should know that this DDoS attack, like all DDoS attacks, was a matter of outside volume that overwhelmed the bandwidth of the network; this was not a situation where any data was compromised.

DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent in cyberspace; they are being experienced in higher education, government and by commercial enterprises. There is no doubt that they will happen again. Rutgers, as you may recall, experienced a five-day DDoS attack that shut down all Internet access during late April and early May of this year.

Since that time, we have made significant and substantial network hardware upgrades, are utilizing DDoS mitigation services, have made Web server improvements and have changed Internet Service Providers to ones that provide additional levels of DDoS threat deterrent capacity.

Despite these enhancements, today's attack, which lasted from about 10:00 a.m. until mid-afternoon, was disruptive and annoying. We apologize for any inconvenience.

You should know that we are working with state and federal law enforcement officials on this matter.

We are working hard to serve you. I thank you again for your patience.

Sincerely,

Don Smith",Network Status – RutgersIT,link,https://rutgersit.rutgers.edu/network-status/,2015-09-28 18:05:23,293,41,53,293,0,0,0,0,0

172636137574_10154299698167575,"Please see the note below from Dr. Barchi regarding the investigation into Coach Flood:

Dear Members of the Rutgers Community:

Since our University was established almost 250 years ago, Rutgers has grown to become the State of New Jersey's premier public institution of higher learning.  With that designation, we have an obligation to provide outstanding educational opportunities, to ensure high quality and productive research, to serve the local, national and world communities, and to do so with integrity and a steadfast commitment to the central academic mission of our university.  It is in this context that I provide you with the following report.  

As some of you may be aware, the University has been reviewing an allegation that the Head Football Coach at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, Kyle Flood, circumvented established policies and procedures in contacting a faculty member to discuss the academic standing of a student-athlete.  This allegation was first reported to the University on August 12th and within 24 hours, after consultations with our Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, with our Interim Senior Vice President & General Counsel and with the Interim Senior Vice President for Enterprise Risk Management, Ethics and Compliance, the University retained an outside investigator and counsel and undertook an investigation of the charge.    

Yesterday, I received the final investigative report and I have decided to release the report, with limited redactions required by privacy laws, as I want the University community to understand both what we now know and the thorough nature of the investigation.  The report is available at http://president.rutgers.edu/files/Final-Report.pdf.

Below is a brief summary of some of the major findings:      

Coach Flood knew or should have known of well-established University policies prohibiting coach-initiated contact between coaches and members of the faculty regarding a student-athlete's academic standing.  The responsibility for such contact strictly rests with our athletics academic advisors under the purview of the Office of the New Brunswick Chancellor.  Coach Flood used his personal email to contact the faculty member and had an in-person meeting with the faculty member regarding the academic standing of a member of the football team.  The multiple email contacts came both before and after the meeting, which occurred at an off-campus location.
A member of the athletics academic advising staff reported that she reminded Coach Flood, after he sent the initial email but before he had the in-person meeting with the faculty member, that he is not to have contact with any faculty member regarding a student's academic standing. Coach Flood nevertheless moved forward with the previously scheduled meeting with the faculty member.  
After meeting with Coach Flood, the faculty member agreed to review an additional paper as partial satisfaction for the requirements of a course the student had already completed.  The paper was submitted to the faculty member but ultimately was not graded and the academic status of the student and his final course grade remained unchanged.  
Coach Flood and the student both have acknowledged that Coach Flood provided grammatical and minor editorial suggestions to the submitted paper.  The Office of Enterprise Risk Management, Ethics and Compliance consulted with senior campus academic officials, including the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Chancellor, Rutgers-New Brunswick, who both agreed, after reviewing the paper before and after the edits, that the assistance provided by Coach Flood was in line with standard student support offered on campus by student learning centers and did not constitute academic misconduct.  
The Office of Enterprise Risk Management, Ethics and Compliance provided me with the report and I have carefully considered the information and discussed its findings with senior leadership, including the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors.  Based on what we know now, it is clear to me that Coach Flood had inappropriate communications with the faculty member in violation of an established policy.  The policy is well-known among staff in the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.  Coach Flood is specifically tasked with knowing both NCAA and our institutional policies regarding these issues.  Simply, Coach Flood has no excuse for not knowing the rule and following it.  

For his violations of University policy, I have suspended Coach Flood for three consecutive games of inter-collegiate competition effective immediately.  I also have imposed a fine of $50,000. 

I believe that the discipline is severe and justified for his failure to follow policy.  I met with Coach Flood this afternoon and informed him of the suspension and the fine and he has accepted responsibility for his actions and my discipline.  As a member of the faculty and as a former Provost myself, I know that Coach Flood's actions in communicating with the faculty member crossed a line that all faculty hold dear.  Our faculty must have complete independence in executing their duties and there is a reason why we prohibit athletics coaching staff from discussing the academic standing of students with faculty.  We have policies in place to protect academic integrity and to ensure that any faculty member, whether tenured or untenured, whether full-time or part-time, is free of intimidation and interference by outside parties.

As a result of today's findings, we are working with outside counsel to determine if any National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bylaws have been violated.  During the course of the investigation, we informed the NCAA Enforcement staff and we will be working with them on next steps.  We will participate in the enforcement/infractions process per our conditions and obligations of membership in the NCAA.  

I have also asked Director of Athletics Julie Hermann to ensure that our compliance training and oversight regarding the athletics staff prohibition on inappropriate contact with faculty regarding a student-athlete is among the best in the nation. 

Over the past three years, we have taken significant steps in establishing a strong compliance and oversight culture and organization on campus, including the creation of the Office of Enterprise Risk Management, Ethics and Compliance in 2013 that reports directly to me and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Governors.  During the Summer and Fall of 2014, I expanded the mission of that office to include across-the-board institutional compliance.  At my direction, the compliance program was structured further to ensure that resources would be available to address the emerging compliance risks of Athletics, Title IX and Research and to strengthen our programs in Ethics and Privacy.  Earlier this summer, that office recruited new expert leadership in each of these areas as well as a new Director of Ethics who brings to the University in-depth experience with the New Jersey State Ethics Commission.  I believe that we now have one of the strongest institutional risk management and compliance programs in higher education.  But it is up to each of us to actualize the goals of this program.

We have high expectations of every member of our community and no one is free from responsibility.  We must use this opportunity to grow, to do more and to do better.  And we will.  

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Robert Barchi

172636137574_10154261478492575,"Please read Dr. Barchi's message to the community following the arrests of seven Rutgers students:

To the Rutgers University–New Brunswick Community:

The arrests yesterday of seven current Rutgers students for assault, robbery, and other charges are deeply troubling to everyone.  The alleged behavior is abhorrent and unacceptable anywhere; particularly so at Rutgers, where we place such a high value on personal integrity and respect for others.

Let me state the obvious: this behavior is not reflective of Rutgers or of the members of our academic community.  However, we must realize that these arrests have the potential to shape an image of the University that only we, together, can confront with a firm commitment to our highest values.

Our code of student conduct is fair and outlines expectations for what it means to be members of the Rutgers community.  It lays out guidelines for responsible behavior by students at Rutgers and we expect everyone to abide by it.  There are consequences for violations of the code, and these students are facing those consequences in addition to facing very serious criminal charges.

Five of these students were members of our football team, and they were immediately suspended from the athletic program at the time of their arrests. In addition, in accordance with university policy, the cases of all seven students have been reviewed by the Dean of Students and, as announced by Chancellor Edwards this morning, they have been placed on interim suspension from the University.  In accordance with our code of conduct, the students do retain the right to appeal our decision.  In the meantime, however, they will not be permitted to enter the Rutgers 
campus unless under supervision.

Rutgers is an outstanding academic institution whose students achieve remarkable success both during and beyond their years here. We work hard to create a rewarding experience for all our students, and fundamental to that experience is the right to feel safe and secure.  Every part of the Rutgers administration, including student affairs, public safety, and academic affairs, is committed to creating the best learning environment.  At the same time, we demand that our students behave with honesty and integrity, and that they exercise personal responsibility toward their fellow students, the greater community at Rutgers, and the 
world beyond our gates.

Sincerely,

Robert Barchi",,status,,2015-09-04 13:45:04,519,70,120,519,0,0,0,0,0

172636137574_10154250144792575,"Please check out this message from Chancellor Edwards about the recent off-campus crime alerts on the New Brunswick campus.

To the Members of the Rutgers University–New Brunswick Community:
 
I want to update you on the incidents that were the subject of crime alerts on Sunday morning and to help give you the tools that you need to be safe and secure in our community.
 
The two incidents reported through off-campus crime alerts on Sunday morning are active investigations by the New Brunswick Police Department (NBPD) and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.  A canvas of both areas has been completed and another will be conducted in an effort to gather additional information about these incidents.  The Rutgers University Police Department (RUPD) will assist in this effort.
 
It is important to note that when crimes do occur to members of the Rutgers community, the Office of Violence Prevention and Victim Assistance, a department that is housed under the Division of Student Affairs, provides immediate support services to crime victims—and such was the case on Sunday morning. 
 
The RUPD and the NBPD have worked together to increase public safety patrols in the 5th and 6th wards of New Brunswick, and these additional patrols will be visible and active.  In addition, the RUPD and NBPD have partnered to form neighborhood patrol teams, which consist of a police officer from each department patrolling the 5th and 6th wards.  This allows for real-time intelligence and for police patrols dedicated to off-campus areas densely populated by members of the Rutgers community.  
 
We will continue to enhance these efforts.  The RUPD has 13 police officers being trained in the police academy and several in field training, and as they enter active duty this fall, they will enable us to increase our public safety presence.  
 
Further, the RUPD, in collaboration with Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Felicia McGinty, has initiated off-campus public safety patrols that are active each night during the academic year.  These patrols are dual purpose, with a focus on crime prevention and providing mobile escorts, along with a variety of other services to Rutgers off-campus students in the 5th and 6th wards.  More details about their services can be found at http://ruoffcampus.rutgers.edu/contact-us/rutgers-university-off-campus-partnership/ . 
 
Rutgers goes beyond what is required by law to regularly notify you whenever a serious crime occurs that may affect the members of our community.  Our notifications regarding serious crimes that occur off-campus are in addition to traditional alerts that are sent for on-campus crimes that meet the criteria under federal law.  Included in these alerts are safety tips specific to the type of incident. 
 
Further, RUPD collaborates each year with the Department of Community Affairs and the Division of Student Affairs to participate in the Good Neighbor Program, in which approximately 900 residences are visited in the off-campus areas of New Brunswick to discuss responsibilities associated with off-campus living, including safety. Our ""Good Neighbor Welcome"" will take place this evening.
 
While it is important to let you know about the university's efforts, Rutgers students should take care to protect themselves and stay safe, including by staying in well-lit areas and walking in groups.  Students living on campus should familiarize themselves with the locations of our emergency ""blue light"" phones. Off-campus students should observe the important safety and security information on the following page: http://ruoffcampus.rutgers.edu/safety-security. And any student can request a security escort at any time of night by calling 732-932-7211.
 
The safety and security of the students, faculty and staff at Rutgers is a top priority. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Richard L. Edwards, Ph.D.

172636137574_10153890462687575,"Please see below for New Brunswick Chancellor Richard Edwards' note to faculty regarding final exam procedures in the wake of network problems:

Dear Faculty Colleague:
 
As you know, Rutgers continues to experience disruptions to its network systemwide. IT teams on our campus and across the University are working diligently and around the clock to correct the situation and to stabilize the system.
 
While we are optimistic that our IT teams will resolve this situation soon, we are confronted by the realities of the academic calendar. It is prudent to be prepared for the possibility that the network will remain challenged into next week, which may pose problems for our students as they complete their assignments and prepare for - and take - final exams, particularly online exams. Fully online and hybrid courses are even more adversely affected.
 
All of the academic deans join me in asking faculty who rely on the network for online exams and final projects to prepare contingencies. 
 
If you intended to offer an online examination, please consider the option of providing a paper exam instead. We understand that this will require scheduling appropriate examination space, and the scheduling office and the offices of each academic dean will make every effort to assist you. You might also consider providing an alternative final assignment, like a short paper.
 
We understand that there are many reasons that you may not choose to substitute with a traditional bluebook exam or alternative assignment. For example students may have to rely upon online resources—such as Sakai and eCollege—to access their course materials, and if those resources cannot be provided, they may not have the information that they need to complete coursework and/or exams. If you choose not to give a traditional bluebook exam or alternative assignment, you can give final grades based on the work that has been done to date. If a student is not satisfied with that result, the student should have two options: the student can receive a ""Pass/Fail"" grade or take an ""Incomplete"" and take the exam when it becomes feasible to do so.
 
In classes that have project deadlines, we encourage you to be flexible and give students an extension when the delay is caused by the disruptions of the network outages, and we ask in particular that you offer special consideration for those students who are poised to graduate this May.
 
If you believe the proposed solutions will not work for your course, please contact your academic dean's office.
 
Please note that the timeline for assigning final grades is still in effect. Should the online grading system be unavailable when final grades are due, a paper alternative will be provided.
  
In advance, thank you for considering options that will allow us to best serve our students in the face of this unprecedented situation. Thank you for your flexibility and understanding as all of us deal with this matter together.
 
Sincerely,
 
Richard L. Edwards, Ph.D.

Over the past several days the Office of Information Technology (OIT) has been implementing a multi-faceted approach in response to the recent technical difficulties.  We have implemented the following measures to reduce and stabilize the issues:

•        Various network hardware upgrades
•        DDoS mitigation services
•        Web server improvements

Simultaneously, OIT and the Rutgers Police Department are actively working in consultation with the FBI and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness to investigate the source of the attacks.  Due to the ongoing investigation, we are unable to share additional details.

At approximately 10:20 a.m. today, one of our undergraduate students was assaulted in Dana Library in Newark by an assailant brandishing a sharp object. The student sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was alert upon being transported from the scene to the hospital. Rutgers University Police Department officers arrived on the scene quickly and apprehended the assailant, who is not a member of the RU-N community and is now in custody.  There is no ongoing threat to the RU-N community.
 
The Chancellor and other RU-N leaders are at the hospital with the student and her family now.
 
The library remains open as normal.  Rutgers University Police Department is reviewing all of the circumstances and evidence.
 
After a distressing incident such as this, it is not uncommon to desire support structures to help us cope.  Counseling services are available for students, faculty, and staff.  Students may contact the Rutgers University – Newark Counseling Center at 973.353.5805.  Employees may contact Rutgers Human Resources/Faculty & Staff Assistance Program at 848.932.3956.

Members of the Rutgers University–New Brunswick Community:
 
I want to echo President Barchi's message of sympathy and support regarding the passing of Rutgers student Caitlyn Kovacs over the weekend.  I offer my deepest sympathy to Caitlyn's parents and family members, and to everyone at the University who knew and called Caitlyn a friend. Our entire community shares in your sorrow at this sudden and tragic loss.  We will continue to hold Caitlyn and her loved ones in our thoughts and prayers.
 
I deeply regret to report that we learned this morning of the passing of another Rutgers student, Darsh Patel, a senior in the School of Arts and Sciences majoring in information technology and informatics.  Darsh was killed in a bear attack yesterday while hiking with friends in a wooded area of Passaic County.  As we grieve over his tragic passing, please know that our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and loved ones and to all his friends and fellow students at Rutgers.
 
Please know that members of the Rutgers community can call CAPS (Counseling, ADAP, and Psychiatric Services) on the College Avenue Campus for counseling at 848-932-7884. A counselor is on call all day Monday through Friday from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm at the counseling center, located at 17 Senior Street in New Brunswick, for those with urgent needs. Today we will also have other counselors available from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm at the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs' conference room on the 4th floor of the College Avenue Student Center.  In addition, the Dean of Students office located at Bishop House on College Avenue will offer open hours today from 9:00 to 5:00 for students needing support or accommodations.  Do not hesitate to take advantage of these services; we are here to help.
 
At the core of our university's mission is our primary concern for the well-being of our students, and it is at heartbreaking moments like this that we must take special care to reach out with compassion and support.
 
Sincerely,

This is a time to let each other know that we care and to share our strength and understanding with those in need so that we come through this tragedy with a deeper commitment to each member of the Rutgers community.
 
I know this is a difficult time for everyone. We are offering grief 
counseling at two locations today at 7 pm. Staff will be available for 
counseling at the Student Activities Center (College Avenue Campus) and in the College Avenue Student Center. Should you feel a need to seek one-on-one counseling to better deal with this enormous sense of loss, please know that grief counseling is available at the university. Call or visit Counseling ADAP & Psychiatric Services (848) 932-7884 or visit http://rhscaps.rutgers.edu/. Our counselors can provide support services, understanding, and assistance to help anyone in the student body better cope with this situation.

We will be in communication with you as soon as we learn more about this tragic event.

Sincerely,

Bob Barchi",Rutgers - Health Services - CAPS,link,http://rhscaps.rutgers.edu/,2014-09-21 11:32:01,175,34,37,175,0,0,0,0,0

172636137574_10153213467387575,"On behalf of Rutgers University and the Athletic Department, we would like to apologize for the regrettable actions of a handful of Rutgers fans on Saturday that do not convey the message of good, competitive spirit that we look forward to having with our new Big Ten rival Penn State University.

Some of the signage and t-shirts that we have been made aware of were both inappropriate and offensive.

I have spoken with and apologized to the Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour and I would like to apologize equally to the Penn State University fans, as well as Rutgers fans that were subjected to this classless display that does not represent the ethos of our university, athletic department or fan base.

The two inappropriate pictures that appeared briefly on our Facebook page as part of a 200-picture montage were immediately removed when we were alerted to their content.

It is unfortunate that the actions of a few spoiled an otherwise historic and recording-setting night that Rutgers fans provided for our first Big Ten football game.

To the Members of the Rutgers New Brunswick Community:

It is with a great sense of sadness that we are writing to let you know that a Rutgers student died last evening in a tragic accident on the New Jersey Turnpike.  A second student was injured in the incident.

Although the circumstances of the accident are still being investigated by the New Jersey State Police, it appears that the students were struck by a motor vehicle while inspecting the vehicle in which they were traveling for mechanical problems.

The deceased student, Santa Pumpra, attended the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick.  Our thoughts and prayers go to her family and friends and to the injured student and his family and friends.

Our community is strengthened and enriched by the contribution of each and every student who has chosen to learn and grow at the University.  We are all diminished when a life is taken from us.

The loss of a loved one, friend or colleague is always difficult; please know that grief counseling and other support services are available to any member of our community through the Office of Student Affairs.

Sincerely,

Robert Barchi

172636137574_10152703943317575,"A letter to the Rutgers community from President Robert Barchi:
 
On May 18, we will welcome former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to deliver the 2014 Rutgers University–New Brunswick commencement address.  In recent weeks, members of our University community have engaged in spirited discussions, and faculty, staff, students, alumni, and a range of individuals from across the nation have written both in strong support of, and in opposition to, Condoleezza Rice as our commencement speaker.  We have even heard from high school students who have written to say that they would withdraw their Rutgers applications if we rescind—or fail to rescind—our invitation to her.  These are the kinds of exchanges that every great university welcomes.  Like all vibrant intellectual communities, Rutgers can thrive only when it vigorously defends the free exchange of ideas in an environment of civil discourse.  Our students—like all members of our University community—benefit from these kinds of energetic civic exchanges, and through them learn to develop, articulate, and defend their own values and their moral and ethical positions.
 
Whatever your personal feelings or political views about our commencement speaker, there can be no doubt that Condoleezza Rice is one of the most influential intellectual and political figures of the last 50 years.  She has been on the Stanford faculty as a professor of Political Science since 1981, and she has won two of the university's highest teaching distinctions.  From 1993 to 1999, she served as Stanford's Provost, the institution's chief academic officer.  In 2001, she accepted the offer to serve in Washington, D.C. as National Security Advisor and later United States Secretary of State, the first woman of color to serve in that role.  In March 2009, Dr. Rice returned to Stanford University as a professor of political economy in the Graduate School of Business and in political science and as the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.  Dr. Rice's success and influence is all the more impressive when considered in the context of her childhood in the segregated South, during the most tumultuous and violent years of the Civil Rights struggle.
 
As many of you have suggested in your letters and in discussions with me, we live in a time when politics can be deeply polarizing.  Like our fellow citizens, you and I—our colleagues—have deep and sincerely held beliefs and convictions that often stand in stark contrast to others around us.  Yet, we cannot protect free speech or academic freedom by denying others the right to an opposing view, or by excluding those with whom we may disagree.  Free speech and academic freedom cannot be determined by any group.  They cannot insist on consensus or popularity.  These principles are, in fact, best illustrated and preserved when we defend perspectives that we oppose or when we protect what may appear to be a minority view. 
 
My hope is that we can use these seemingly controversial moments to reaffirm our commitment to open and civil discourse.  Indeed, they provide strong evidence of a healthy and engaged University community.  I will continue to work with you to guarantee the University remains a space where ideas can be considered, discussed, and debated, a space that embraces and defends civil discourse, free speech, and academic freedom.
 
Sincerely,

STATEMENT BY RUTGERS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT ROBERT L. BARCHI REGARDING MIKE RICE

Rutgers University has a long and proud history as one of the nation's most diverse and welcoming academic institutions. Coach Rice's abusive language and actions are deeply offensive and egregiously violate the university's core values. 

When video excerpts of basketball practices were reviewed last fall by Athletic Director Tim Pernetti, he immediately notified me and sought the advice of internal and outside counsel.  The university hired an independent investigator to look into this matter thoroughly. Based on the external investigator's findings and recommendations, Tim and I agreed that Coach Rice should be suspended, penalized $75,000 in fines and lost salary, ordered to undergo anger management counseling, and put on notice that his behavior would be closely monitored. Tim Pernetti also made it clear to Coach Rice that there would be zero tolerance for additional infractions. Tim kept me fully apprised and I supported his actions.

 Yesterday, I personally reviewed the video evidence, which shows a chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior. I have now reached the conclusion that Coach Rice cannot continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership, responsibility and public accountability. He cannot continue to coach at Rutgers University. Therefore, Tim Pernetti and I have jointly decided to terminate Mike Rice's employment at Rutgers.",,status,,2013-04-03 09:35:56,305,201,92,305,0,0,0,0,0

Due to the Rutgers vs. Louisville football game on Thursday, November 29, heavy traffic is expected on the Busch and Livingston campuses by mid-afternoon.  

The following parking lot closures and changes are effective for that day:

The Stadium West Lot will be closed the entire day. All Busch commuter students with Zone B parking permits will be allowed to park on the Livingston Campus (Yellow Lot).
Lots 48, 53A, 59, 60A, 60B, 64, 67 and 67B will close at 2pm to faculty, staff, and residents. Those already parked in the lots will not be forced to move their cars at that time. Drivers may exit the lots without restrictions after 2pm.

People are urged to take advantage of the Rutgers transit system and not drive on game day, if at all possible. Plan ahead and leave extra time for traveling between campuses for meetings and classes. Those going to the stadium, should try to get there as early as possible to avoid the rush and crowds.

Regularly scheduled and football season bus service will be in effect on November 29.

Buses from College Avenue will discharge passengers at Johnson Park for the short walk to the stadium.

172636137574_159709040842503,"IMPORTANT: Students who continue to struggle in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy should read through this entire post to learn more about your options for your grades and credits this semester.

We have heard from many members of the Rutgers community that significant numbers of students continue to struggle in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.  Homes and communities have been damaged or destroyed, power and water services have been disrupted, fuel supplies have been restricted, and, most tragically, scores of people have died.  Many of you live in areas that continue to be affected by the storm and its aftermath, which has made it difficult for you to prepare for and to attend classes or to complete your assignments.  

For those of you who have experienced hardships in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, we urge you to avail yourselves of the academic assistance that is always available for our students.  Take advantage of academic support services, including those within your department or School, and make appointments to visit your professors to talk about issues you are having.  Discuss with them the possibility of making up work, acquiring additional time for assignments, and, as a last resort and only in instances of real hardship, arranging for a temporary grade that will permit you to complete your coursework during the winter recess.  Please note that the final recourse with each of these remedies is up to individual faculty members, but we urge you to communicate with all of your professors about any distress you are suffering as a result of the hurricane.  Like you, our faculty members have experienced the effects of this historic natural disaster, and most are eager to assist you during this difficult time.  

Because so many students have contacted us with concerns that hurricane-related hardships are affecting their GPA and academic performance, Rutgers is implementing a one-time policy that will allow undergraduate and pre-professional students adversely impacted by the hurricane to have their Fall 2012 course grades converted to Pass/No Credit (""Pass"" is a grade of C or better).  If, after exhausting all of the options available for academic support, you feel that you cannot do your work because you continue to be affected in the storm's aftermath, you can go online and fill out a Grade Conversion Application: https://sakai.rutgers.edu/convertpf.jsp .  In the application, you will be asked to describe briefly the hardships you have experienced that are directly related to Hurricane Sandy and that continue to have a significant impact on your academic progress during this semester.  Should you choose to have ALL of your grades for the Fall semester 2012 converted to Pass/No credit (you cannot select individual courses for the grade conversion), you will need to complete the Grade Conversion Application before midnight on Monday, November 19, 2012.  If you do choose this option and complete the online application, you cannot reverse your decision later.

Please note that this option should not be taken lightly.  You should first consult with academic counselors in your department or School to understand the full ramifications of such a decision for your particular academic major or career path.  For example, in some cases, courses without an assigned letter grade can negatively affect applications to some professional programs and graduate schools.  If you opt for the grade conversion, however, a footnote on your transcript for Fall 2012 will reflect that the grade conversion was part of a University-wide program for students adversely impacted by Hurricane Sandy in Fall 2012.  Nevertheless, some programs, including law schools, treat grades of P as equivalent to C.  In addition, a conversion to Pass/No Credit may adversely affect students who are on financial aid probation.

This program is designed to be confidential with respect to the decision you make about using the Pass/No Credit option.  If you choose the option of a Grade Conversion, you are not obligated to share your decision with anyone, including your professors.  Note that if you opt to convert your grades and you additionally take a temporary grade, your final grade, after you make up that temporary grade, will also convert to Pass/No Credit.  

As President Barchi stressed this week, this has been an extremely challenging time for so many people in New Jersey and in the tri-state area.  But the storm and its aftermath have also shown that the Rutgers community is resilient, and we will continue to work together through this difficult period.",https://sakai.rutgers.edu/convertpf.jsp,link,https://sakai.rutgers.edu/convertpf.jsp,2012-11-09 14:04:51,58,5,30,58,0,0,0,0,0

Campus Status Update
October 30, 2012
5:00 p.m.

Officials at Rutgers are continuing to monitor conditions on our New
Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses and throughout the region in the
aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.  The impact of the storm has been described
by State and public safety officials as unprecedented.

During the height of the storm, the electrical infrastructure throughout
the region sustained major damage.  Widespread power outages continue,
which are significantly affecting campus operations, as well as the lives
of our students, faculty, staff and their families.  Public transportation
in parts of New Jersey is compromised due to flooding and electrical
problems.  In New Brunswick, the public water supply has also been
affected.

After personally assessing conditions on the Rutgers campuses in New
Brunswick and Piscataway, and consulting with the Chancellors of our
campuses in Newark and Camden, President Barchi has determined that the
conditions vary among the three campuses.  The impact of the storm on the
New Brunswick and Newark campuses is much more severe than the damage
sustained in Camden.

Therefore, all daytime and evening classes on the New Brunswick and Newark
campuses are cancelled through Friday, November 2, 2012.  Classes on the
New Brunswick and Newark campuses will resume Monday, November 5, 2012.

Classes on the Camden campus are cancelled Wednesday, October 31 only. 
Classes on the Rutgers-Camden campus are scheduled to resume Thursday,
November 1, 2012.  Rutgers-Camden students should check the Rutgers-Camden
website for additional information.

President Barchi has also extended the closure of offices and the
cancellation of programs on all campuses of Rutgers University, through
5:00 p.m. Wednesday, October 31.  Employees critical to operations, and to
the health and safety of our campus community, will still report to work
as specified by their supervisor.  Normal operating conditions resume for
all employees at 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 31.

In New Brunswick, storm damage caused the failure of the New Brunswick
Water pumping system, which has resulted in a critical loss of water
throughout the city. The university has been advised by New Brunswick
Authorities that the water system cannot sustain domestic and fire
protection needs.

Therefore, Public Safety and Residence Life authorities are requesting
that any students on our New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses who can
safely return to their homes do so at this time.  We have been advised by
County Emergency Management authorities that all major roadways are open
at this time.  Any student who is unable to leave the campus will be
relocated to Residence Halls within the Township of Piscataway where the
water system has remained unaffected.

Public safety officials are currently in the process of relocating
students and we ask that you contact your residence hall adviser for
instructions regarding relocation from your residence hall.  While we
regret the inconvenience of these actions, they are necessary to ensure
the health and safety of our students.

• You will be safer in your residence hall room, apartment or home than on the road or outside on campus.
• During high winds it is not safe to venture outside since flying debris can be deadly.
• Sheltering-in-place is often the safest course of action for individuals who are not in a storm surge or flood-prone area.
• Because of hazardous weather and road conditions, you can help keep the roads clear for emergency workers, and for those who may have to evacuate due to danger in their area.
• Close windows and doors in your room or apartment during the storm. Stay away from glass pane windows. Interior rooms provide better protection.
• Hurricanes can have a ""lull"" so don't assume the storm is over until you have confirmation from a reliable news source.
• If you have a refrigerator turn it to the coldest setting and keep it closed as much as possible so that food will last longer if the power goes out.
• Make sure you know the evacuation route within your building.
• Make sure your cell phone is fully charged.
• You should carry family contact information with you during the storm.
• Stay alert for extended rainfall and subsequent flooding even after a hurricane or tropical storm has ended.
• Drive only if necessary and avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges.
• Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately.
• Stay out of any building that has water around it.
• Avoid the use of candles if you lose power.
• If you have a flashlight keep it somewhere easily accessible to you. 
• Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it's not contaminated.
• Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.
• Use the telephone only for emergency calls.
• Depending on your residence, ensure that outdoor trash cans, potted plants, bikes and other loose object are secured or moved inside -- if possible to keep them from becoming projectiles in the wind. If not, make sure these items are secured.
• Remember that text messages can often get around network disruptions when a phone call might not be able to get through.
• Please remember to cooperate fully with public safety, other university staff, and local officials during the storm.
• Continue to monitor the Campus Status Page athttp://campusstatus.rutgers.edu/ for the latest updates.

This operation was conducted along with the Essex County Bomb Squad and the Newark Police Special Operations Division. The teams found potentially dangerous materials in the student's room and removed the materials. Subsequently students from University Square, Woodward Hall and Talbott Hall were evacuated. 

The student whose room contained potentially dangerous materials was arrested on multiple charges.  Another evacuation of University Square was ordered a short while ago. The FBI is now involved with this matter. FBI officials informed Rutgers-Newark today that a potentially hazardous substance that would not have been detected by the squads last night should be further investigated. 

The Rutgers University Police are handling this situation with the well being and safety of everyone in the campus community foremost in mind. Further information will be given as it becomes available.",,status,,2012-02-08 14:11:07,9,11,18,9,0,0,0,0,0
