21105780752_10154153472870753,"""I'm involved in a company I started with my friend Morgan Lerner called Go Bananas. We bake every Sunday morning and deliver our bread every Sunday night.

I've been baking my whole life. I've always brought cupcakes or cookies or banana bread to school. And when I came to college, I would bring little gift bags to my friends filled with baked goods. And that's actually how I met my business partner Morgan, because we both loved to bake. That's how we bonded. My cousin, who's actually in Ross, suggested that I start selling some of my baked goods. And one day I invited my friend Morgan to come home to Bloomfield Hills with me to bake. During the car ride, I had told her what my cousin said and she agreed and was like 'We should do a banana bread business!'...and so now we're here.

The first time we tried baking, we actually burnt the bread. And it was just a complete disaster. But the bottom part was salvageable and it still tasted amazing, so we knew we were on to something. My favorite part about baking is messing up, because that's always where the magic happens. It was really hard for Morgan because she was so upset that we burnt our bread but I was like ""No, this is good!"" Our key secret is that we roast our bananas and I figured that out because I left the bananas in the toaster by accident, and they turned brown because they had been baking in the toaster, and I didn't know what to do with them, and my mom suggested that we used it for our banana bread. And it was so sweet because of the caramelization, and now it's a key component in our recipe.

I can't wait to see what Go Bananas has in store for us in the future!"" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.232318455752.144501.21105780752/10154153472870753/?type=3,2016-11-21 12:26:29,482,22,24,466,16,0,0,0,0

""How did you two meet on campus? Tell us your story."" 

In 2006, my friends and I planned a trip to Miami over spring break. Warren had planned to go to Cancun, but his hotel had been damaged in Hurricane Katrina and he had to make new plans. Warren and his friends ended up in Miami for spring break, and that's where we finally saw what had been in front of our faces all along. Shortly after returning to Ann Arbor we started dating. 
Warren was accepted into University of Michigan School of Dentistry(UMSOD) and started in the Fall of 2006. I needed an extra semester of undergrad to complete my requirements, so I applied to dental school for the following year. When I was also accepted to UMSOD, we were ecstatic that we would still be able to be together. After four rigorous years at the nation's top dental school, we ended up working together in a dental practice 45 minutes north of Ann Arbor at Caring Smiles Family Dentistry, P.C. #UMichLove",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.232318455752.144501.21105780752/10154069530105753/?type=3,2016-10-20 10:12:53,273,9,6,249,24,0,0,0,0

21105780752_10154061137275753,"The client that left the most impact was the first client of mine who passed away. People focus on HIV being a manageable chronic illness, which it is‚Äîa very manageable chronic illness. It's not a death sentence like we thought it was in the '80s. However, there are still people who are dying from HIV/AIDS complications. Clients have died nearly every year since I started working as an HIV/AIDS testing advocate. 

The reason this client had such a big impact on me wasn't only that he was the first client of mine who had passed on, it was that I didn't find out from his family, I found out from his nurse. 

I didn't even get a chance to go to his funeral.

And it‚Ä¶it hurt me for a lot of reasons. One, I felt a lack of closure with that client and with his family. And two, I knew that that client was not open with his family about his diagnosis. I recently realized that a lot of my clients are dying from the stigma of having HIV/AIDS, rather than the disease itself. Because he had this internal negative stigma and he couldn't be honest about his diagnosis with his family, I feel that he may have passed in isolation, maybe in loneliness, because he wasn't taking his medication, because to take that medication was a daily reminder that his family saw his illness as a curse or punishment for being who he was. 

You can say you have cancer or kidney disease or liver disease and people will be more than sympathetic toward you, and rightfully so. But once you say that you have HIV, it's a whole different story. So a lot of people isolate themselves and suffer in silence. The disease itself is curable, but it's the internalized negative stigmatization of HIV that's fatal. Not many other chronic illnesses come with stigma and judgment. Even when they're caused by poor health habits, diseases like diabetes and lung cancer come with sympathy. There's a humanness to those kinds of diseases. There's no humanness in HIV. It's ""How dare you be this terrible person to contract this disease?""

There's so much homophobia and other puritanical issues with the transmission of HIV. There's not a conversation about prevention, or about HIV being a manageable disease. It's a combination of homophobia and lack of education. The other marginalized group with HIV are drug users, so having HIV loops you into these two extremely undesirable demographics.  #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.232318455752.144501.21105780752/10154061137275753/?type=3,2016-10-17 11:20:43,182,13,13,143,21,1,0,17,0

So since I've been a little kid, all over the house, we've had the Block M and I've always wanted to be a part of it. And we have this picture of this huge, aggressive wolverine with an M above it. I always associated anything Michigan with my dad.

When I was in the equivalent of high school in Ireland and looking at my options for university, I always had Michigan in mind as a place, but unfortunately, when i got my results, they weren't exactly up to what I wanted. I was really sad and down because all of my friends were heading to college, when I had no offers. I used the Wolverine image back home as motivation. All of the images and feelings that I associated with the Wolverine really helped me stay grounded and achieve the goals that I needed to achieve to get to Michigan.

I applied again, got in, and honestly, it literally changed my world. I did Kinesiology and I was a health and fitness major. I also played club rugby here. My dad's friend actually stopped by to watch me play; it was my first game, and I scored, so that made him really proud. #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.232318455752.144501.21105780752/10154041618315753/?type=3,2016-10-10 12:36:46,1834,66,14,1739,90,3,2,0,0

There are so many distractions at any university that you attend that it's very easy to get thrown off track. Students oftentimes don't remember or don't realize that it's easier to destroy a GPA than it is to rebuild one. And so it only takes a couple of bad decisions to destroy your GPA and it can take semesters, if that's even possible, to recover that GPA. So 1: always remember why you're here; 2:  do everything that you need to do to stay here; and 3: meet with your academic advisor as often as you possibly can.

I would like to pursue a doctoral degree. I have a strong interest in seeing how we can better serve college students who have autism. There's not a lot of research out there about helping students transition from K-12 to college, or about helping guide them from year 1-4 once they're here. I know where I was before we were seeing increased numbers with students with autism, and I'm sure that's the case with many students across the country. I really want to do some research to look at how we can better serve those students.""

21105780752_10153822560600753,"""The earth has roughly 7 billion people. Currently, we are using roughly 14 billion metric tons of concrete per year. So it's two tons per year, per person. That's a lot of material. Concrete is the most widely used material in the world, more so than steel. It's very popular. And for good reason, despite all of its deficiencies I talked about earlier. So standard concrete isn't leaving us anytime soon. It will be around for a while. But because of its high energy investment and significant carbon footprint‚Äîand its use in large-¬¨scale quantities‚Äîa lot of good can be done by reversing the material used, little by little in terms of concrete's environmental impact.

Flexible concrete was invented at U-M in 2006, but is now being studied around the world. Last time I checked, about 36 countries were researching flexible concrete. But U-M wasn't the first to create flexible, ductile material. The first was nature. So it turns out that one of the secrets of nature is that it has a lot of interfaces within the material. So the microstructure is actually like architecture, but on a very small scale. It's deliberately designed inside. And it's arranged in such a way that if you overload it, the microstructure is like brick layers, and they tend to slip over one another rather than breaking into two parts.

So in some sense we are emulating nature. I wouldn't say we're doing the same thing, but we borrow a lot of ideas from nature and incorporate it into our work.

Infrastructure is something we all use. No one argues that we should get rid of our buildings, roads, or bridges. And these structures will be with us for a long time. Having said that, we also need the natural environment.

Like radical terrorist groups, even, how they can be the way that they are because they've been in such turmoil all their lives, and probably lost their family members and everything. It's cool to see the perspective from all sides.

I'm really looking forward to being in an apartment in the fall, and it's going to be nice just to have all my friends together and not be cooped up in a dorm all the time. I'm also taking some really awesome classes this upcoming semester. I'm taking this one psychology class with the head of the complex systems department, David Axelrod, so that's gonna be really cool. I'm also taking a philosophy class that I'm really looking forward to. They're both directly a part of my Cognitive Science major, especially with my decision-making track. It's mostly philosophy, psychology, and econ, but you can pick electives with it so I'm going to try and do political science as well."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153807717590753/?type=3,2016-07-06 09:39:13,288,6,9,277,9,2,0,0,0

21105780752_10153778811605753,"""I graduated from college in 1959, and for 20 years I worked as a nurse in emergency services at Chelsea. And that's when I left, I retired, and started my genealogy classes. I always liked history, but I knew nothing about genealogy, not a clue, until I met my future professor at my son's retirement party in Virginia. It's not such a big leap, if you think about it. When you're triaging people, and you're doing a step-by-step analysis of what they are presenting to you, after awhile you just get a feel for people; you know, who's legitimate, who's glossing over something, who's embellishing. It just comes to you.

""I do genealogy research for the collections the curators are interested in, like finding backgrounds or what they're known for. I've done several large collections. Some of them want to know if they can put two families together in one collection, as opposed to two collections. And sometimes it's just trying to find a person's name. We had a diary from World War II. I had his address, I had everything but his name. And he was writing in 1943 and 1945, so I went to the 1940 census and his name and his family were not there. Well‚Äîthe family was there, but it didn't list the people. It talked about the father, mother, and sisters, but no names. And of course, I couldn't find him. I felt like I had hit a brick wall. So I still have it, you know; so one of these days maybe something will pop up.

""The research is the reason I love this job. You learn something every day that you never knew before. I just finished up working on the Grimk√© family; it took two and a half years. And it was an amazing project: reading the Grimk√© letters, researching the people that were mentioned in the letters, gathering data to help our researchers because many of them don't have the money to stay here all summer to do research.""

The Weld-Grimk√© Family Papers document the lives of Sarah M. Grimk√©, Angelina E. Grimk√© Weld, and Theodore D. Weld, prominent abolitionists and women's rights advocates. The collection is made up of extensive correspondence and other materials related to their involvement in anti-slavery movements, including letters from other prominent activists such as William Lloyd Garrison and James G. Birney. A recent addition to the Weld-Grimk√© Family Papers contains around 1,000 letters, primarily revolving around Angelina Grimk√© Weld's children and grandchildren.

21105780752_10153734780115753,"I had to rebuild my life. I was starting over from square one. I had to go cold turkey on cigarettes, and I started going to community college. One summer I was working 50 hours a week and going to school full time. I applied myself and really started thinking that it might be possible to go to UofM. I heard that people could transfer, and about the average GPA, and my first semester at community college I got A's. I was surprised.

I thought the Blavin Scholars program was really cool. It looked awesome, and I wanted to be a part of it. I wasn't sure what the requirements were, if I could get in or if it was a select group of people or something. I reached out to Emily Hurtado-Arboleda and she was just really, really helpful. She's so friendly, and went above and beyond. I had a really complicated case, and she helped me get in. She wanted me to come. It's not just me: she wants to help everyone. She paved the way. And once I got into the program, everyone was really friendly. It's not one of those things where it's like ""if you do this or this, you're out!"". They want to help you, and you feel safe.

My campus coach was Miriam Connelly. My mom has a lot of health problems, and I have to drive out a lot to Canton to help take care of her and check on her, for emotional support and support around the house. It was a lot of money going back and forth. It was a tough situation. Miriam helped me find more funding, and helped me to manage my budget. She helped give me resources, and I got some expenses approved. She's always there any time something went wrong: struggling in a class, not having money for things, broken car, broken laptop. She's always there to laugh or talk, and is so kind. She has a great sense of humor, and we definitely clicked right away.

My happiest moments haven't been academic: it's more about the relationships I've built. I feel proud of them. The friendships I've built, and the kind of communities I've become a part of, those are what I value the most. I take pride in being here and knowing these people. #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153734780115753/?type=3,2016-06-01 09:30:33,338,16,23,318,19,1,0,0,0

It's something that my parents nurtured throughout my childhood and high school years and it was something that always felt right to me‚Äîso I kept at it. There was one moment, in seventh or eighth grade, and I was debating between science and art. And now I've integrated both!

So I started to think about relationships and I started to think about family experiences and when someone in your family is ill, the illness becomes part of the family. You see someone's true vulnerabilities and you also see your own vulnerabilities. Together, you find strengths during time of illness and it's something that I think a lot about, and I want to be able to bring that to the forefront through my work‚Äîto acknowledge who we are as people, and that we both have limitations as well as strengths, and in our culture we only show one side of us.

It's easy to say ""hey, I'm a leader"", but there's actually a lot of interactions that you might have to have with people that are difficult, and you don't realize that before you're actually in that position. Part of it is learning how we work together as a team: we're both very different people, so we balance each other out in certain ways. We're pretty complimentary. So at least between us, learning how to present a unified front, and working out our dynamic, has been pretty interesting. We were friends first. That's actually an even bigger difficulty: being friends and then working together in a professional setting. That transition is so hard. We haven't hung out since October: it always becomes work.

We're hoping to create a platform for kids that are interested in public health to write about their new research or maybe explore their passions within the field. We just want to give undergrads the opportunity to engage within this field that they don't normally have access to.

For the season opener against Camp Grant, Michigan's starting line-up consisted of six marines, four sailors, and one civilian engineering student.

I'm not really sure why because we usually give everything away. So, we had this big amount of stuff and over the summer when we went to visit, she told us that we were going to give this stuff away. So, I helped my mom, little me, get these huge containers and put them outside to fill with toys, and everything that was still in good condition.

21105780752_10153564516335753,"""Growing up with a hyperawareness of my identities has resulted in an appreciation for the similarities that all people have, and has motivated me to serve and help address local issues to ensure a healthy community. I use the term community very broadly. That to me indicates both domestic and international, it means people in general. During undergrad at Michigan, I was able to develop skills in social justice education and awareness, while also having the ability to work directly to combat healthcare disparities. As a medical student at Michigan, I was part of the inaugural class for the Global Health and Disparities Path of Excellence, which played a fundamental role in providing protected time to review current literature, discuss disparity models, network with classmates and other faculty, and provide structured support for community disparity experiences. Early in my M1 year, I helped launched the University of Michigan Student Run Free Clinic (SRFC). While working on developing different models for SRFC, I began to appreciate the importance of research in any service work. During the summer of my M1 year, I interned for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) as a medical assistant in the Kulandia refugee camp, where I also piloted a bilingual health assessment survey. This experience provided both a dose of reality that colored the rest of my medical school experience, helping me appreciate the opportunities provided to me, as well as identified my research shortcomings. This realization prompted me to take a year off from medical school to attain formal research and statistical training by completing a Master's of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR). I organized an international immersion experience at the end of my MSCR in order to apply all of the research skills that I have developed while also having the opportunity to work with refugees again prior to residency. I put together a mentorship team of Michigan and Jordanian experts, secured funding and planned an experience that included clinical rotationsat the King Hussein Cancer Center, University of Jordan and private hospitals, conducted a qualitative assessment of otitis media and volunteered work with Syrian Refugees. Working with refugees, again, prior to residency was humbling for me, especially considering my background. I met people in the refugee camps who looked similar to me and had similar cultural and religious upbringings as mine; the only thing separating us is my grandfather's decision to immigrate to provide opportunities for his grandchildren. I now have an appreciation of my opportunities as responsibilities, providing a different level of dedication for service work than before."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153564516335753/?type=3,2016-03-16 11:33:58,157,3,12,151,6,0,0,0,0

So, what I worry about and what I care about is that first generation college students coming to Michigan first and foremost are happy, excited to be here and show their incredible strengths and talents while thriving towards graduation.""

""What are some things first generation college students have to go through that others might not understand since they have not experienced what it's like?"" 
""Some are just the interactions with family. Continuing Gen students can often step quickly through conversations with parents because they have gone to college and you don't have to have a translation between your experience and your parents/guardian's' experiences. That's from everything from an internship, to what kind of class should I take, to where should I go to get support and help. Those are sort of off the table for most first gens as even a question to ask parents. The other is the whole notion of what's often known as taking advantage of cultural capital. How do I know the way the place operates? So, if most of my parents friends and my own friends have the experience of going to college who knows how they operate, first generation students are essentially creating something new. They're being trail blazers and entrepreneurs and figuring out how to navigate through this place.""

""How would you describe your college experience as a first generation college student?""
""I was very fortunate to have a lot of good support, but what hasn't changed in 33 years, since now I work with many 18 year olds who come in, is the experience I just described. We didn't have cellphones back then, but we had phones in the hallway that friends of mine would use to call their parents and talk about their experience to conversations around things like what it's like to fill out FAFSA, where in the institution to seek help, etc.. If you're a first generation student, and this is true for me too, when FAFSA forms or other University materials came in the mail, my mother simply said, 'There's something in the mail for you.' I didn't even understand or have talk with my parents about the multiple opportunities universities can provide to expand my education. For example, I wasn't able to go on a study abroad program, not because there wasn't any opportunity, but I didn't know even to ask or to talk about how to do that, and nor did my parents. I often say that you could think about putting together a group of first generation students in a circle and listen to them talk, and what you would hear is how entrepreneurial the first gens are without even knowing it. They've navigated all of these waters saying, 'Well, I don't know how to do that, so I'll just figure it out.' Strength is also what I experienced. I suspect that I'm more of a risk taker in part because what do I have to lose? I don't know what I'm doing anyway, so I'm just going to try for it."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor #UMich1stGen",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153544804430753/?type=3,2016-03-09 15:39:45,333,18,51,326,7,0,0,0,0

I am very competitive; seeing my male counterparts get better grades than me pushed me to work so much better, and to study so much harder and to go after what I wanted. Because, if I don't, they're just going to take it.  I've definitely had to fight for everything I earned, and that's what we have to do as women. I don't mean to say that guys don't work hard at their academics, it's just a fact that women aren't as well represented in the sciences and I don't think it's because there aren't women that don't enjoy the sciences. We have to really fight, and we can't be just good; we have to be excellent at what we do in order to get what we want. It's way more competitive, but for me that definitely doesn't detract from the fun that science brings.""

Who was an influential Woman in your life? ""My grandmother. She is one of the strongest people I know and she definitely inspires me every day. I idolize her. I think she is very independent, but she's very smart about how she plays her independence because she knows when to take a step back. I think that in itself is something that is important to learn. Being in academics, we're always taught to go for it, go for it, go for it. But, she has taught me when to take a step back, and let other people also contribute instead of one person just doing all of the work. She influences me so much, she's definitely my favorite person.""

What's the dream for you? ""I would say that the dream is to never stop growing. To continue to challenge yourself and try new things. I think that the dream is going for what makes you passionate and being able to make something out of what you love. More often than not people change themselves in order to fit the mold of what other people want and say, to me that isn't living, that isn't the dream.""

Who's someone that inspires you? ""My best friend Jeny. She and I went to the same middle school and she is one of the smartest people I know.  She always had such a drive and never failed at anything she set her mind to, that definitely made me want to do as well as she was able to. I didn't want to be complacent with my grades anymore I wanted to show her that I could do the same thing. It wasn't a competition, it was more of a, 'You inspire me because you're able to do this, and since you can do it I want to achieve the same.'  I had another friend that I met during high school that really pushed me to do my best. He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself and really showed me how to go after what I want.

""I like all the different parts that are here. I love the greeters. I've always been in food. I'm a big food guy. So, being a part of that production gets me going. I love what we're doing and I enjoy getting to work with the professionals I have here, who work to put out the best they have. To see those two things come together, and to have people enjoy what we've done for the day is always exciting. We also get a lot of people telling us they love the music that plays throughout the dining hall. But, I can't take the credit for that one. I'm just really good at choosing radio stations on Pandora Radio.""

""What's something you love about North Quad?""
""My comment cards are a huge thing for me. It's kind of how I establish a relationship with many who come in. I make sure I stay current with those, and the messages there and conversations are real. So, I'll follow up with them and ask them what exactly they meant when they were asking for a specific food dish, or cereal. Some students though have left really interesting comments that are actually poetry! It's always fun to hear what students have to say!

""Last semester, we had an exchange student who was visually-impaired from Egypt, and he came in here. He liked the place so much that he was in here 3 or 4 times a day. He knew us all from the sounds of our voices, and told us he wanted to work here! We found a place where he could safely work, and that was quite a thrill for him and everyone working here. We all enjoyed having that connection as well.""

What's always been your dream?""
""That's a hard one. I've always wanted to enjoy myself at work. Work is work, but still, at the end of the day you should be able to say, that was time well spent. I'm glad I did that. Right now, I've had a lot of different jobs at the University, and with this one I get to see 1,500 to 2,000 people throughout the day. That can be pretty engaging and exciting.

21105780752_10153506697640753,"""I think for me, since I was always a shy kid, I wished to be able to talk to people without that original awkwardness. Just being able to go up to people and start up a conversation out of the blue. When someone said something racist or discriminatory, I wanted to be able to defend myself and others.

I'm still figuring out what I'm studying since I'm just a Freshman! I really want to have a career in something that I can help people out with, so I've been looking into social entrepreneurship and business.  I want to be able to use my skills in a helpful way. And Art! I definitely want to include Art in my life somehow. I've always been involved in Art my whole life, and my parents have always been so supportive too! I really like acrylic painting, but I've also start delving into digital painting.

What inspired me to start the Peace Initiative project really started off with me being really frustrated with how Muslims were being treated and the rise of Islamophobia. I hated the fact that people make snap judgements about what type of person I am just by what I look like and wear. To express my frustration, I ended up starting my own art portfolio with the theme of social acceptance. I wanted to creatively show that Muslims aren't as scary as the media paints them to be. In the beginning of the school year, my friend and I were walking by the Diag where Optimize had their table set up. I had no ideas for their social innovation challenge, but my friend was like, 'Let's go and check this out!' and I got dragged into going up to the table. The founder of Optimize was there and he came over to us and asked if we had any ideas and I remember thinking, 'No!' But, when he asked me, 'If there is one thing in the world that you'd want to change, what would you change?"" that got me thinking. We ended talking about Islamophobia and the negative effects of discrimination in general and I brought up the fact that I was working on a portfolio to use art to combat Islamophobia. He loved it and told me to apply to the social innovation challenge, and I did! So, that's how the Peace Initiative got started.

The biggest goal is to put up art in public places around Ann Arbor and start an online campaign through Facebook to reach out to the people who normally wouldn't push themselves to meet new people and learn about different cultures.  We want to put a simple artwork, say on the diag, that students glance at as they walk by to class and take something to think about from the piece. We want to put art about things that aren't common knowledge to break stereotypes; provide less-known perspectives about controversies and social issues we are facing today to get people thinking, 'Woah, I did not know this' and stimulate conversation and get people to question and rethink the stereotypes they believe about different people.

So, I never really thought that I would attend the University of Michigan. When I got here, I felt really lost, like most Freshmen do. I didn't have a large friend group coming in and one of the first things that I decided to do was rush. I never thought I was going to be in a sorority growing up. None of my family was in greek life. They still make fun of me for being in it and they still don't know what sorority I'm in ""the one with the deltas?"" - they say. It was just one of the best decisions that I've made in general. It was such a welcoming environment. It's hard to explain to people who aren't in greek life because the experience is just so unique. One of the things I cared about in high school was community service, and I got here and didn't know how to get truly involved. From the get go, greek life offered that to me. My sorority in particular donates to St. Jude's Children's Hospital and Mott Children's Hospital and last year we raised close to $70,000 in one semester. That was just an incredible feeling to be able to be a central part of that and to give back to the community.""

""Right now Greek Life doesn't have the best reputation due to a lot of negative attention. It can be very frustrating to some, but I see it as more of an opportunity for improvement. We have an incredible opportunity to change the image of Greek Life and to bring positivity to our campus.

""My senior quote was ""The believer is happy, the doubter is wise."" Kind of inspires me to not be afraid to question things. Whether it's in class or just questioning parts of my faith. I think the best way to learn is questioning, and that's what this quote expresses! I also think it's important to be honest and real with people, even if it hurts; it's easier said than done! It definitely depends on the circumstance, but I feel like in most cases, hiding something will always come back and bite you.

""What's the dream?"" 

""My more personal dream is to travel around the world. Pretty much the only international experience I had was when I went to India to visit my family back in '06, but even then, we just stayed in one area and didn't really go anywhere.

So, students need to understand the history of these sorts of student protests on campus; whether it's the Black Action Movements or the United Coalition Against Racism during the 1980s, and then also, I think in addition to that, I think students need to involve themselves in these movements and these protests as much as possible because these issues regarding diversity and policing are very important and can not only just save people of color's lives, but help improve their own experiences on campus as well.""

""I'm accomplishing the goals that I wanted to accomplish by trying to become a historian and trying to change the world around me. But, if there was something that I wanted to do that I would love doing would be running some sort of hip hop publication, some sort of rap magazine. That would be pretty cool. I don't know what the mission of the magazine would be, but I think what I would want such a publication to do is be able to synthesize, not only what's going on with people who perform Hip Hop or who are in the Hip Hop culture, but to synthesize what's going on now with the historical aspects and also the political aspects of the culture as well.  I think a lot of publications now are doing a much better job of connecting all of those issues, but I think if you have folks who like to also study the history of Hip Hop, that would be great.""

""Not particularly. I think the concept is great. A fresh start. A chance to do something you've always wanted. But, why do we all have to wait until the 1st of every year to celebrate the choice to do something good for ourselves? When I was little, I used to make a big deal about it and create a list of 10 things I wanted to change. But, like most of us, I didn't stick to them and all that list did was make me feel disappointed in myself. I've since now realized that I don't do well with the added pressure of New Year's Resolutions. The best time for me to do what it is that I want to do is when I decide that that is the best time for me to do it. So, I like the idea of the new year and a fresh start, but I think that we need to understand that any day can be just as ""refreshing"" as January 1st.""

""I guess my favorite thing about being home is definitely that sense of warmth and comfort. And also just getting to unravel and see the bigger picture. I think when you're in college and school you tend to have a focused mindset on 'I need to do x, y, and z.'  Like, say if it's studying for an exam and you're really stressed out about it, you're really worried, and you feel like your life depends on it. Or maybe you're applying for a job and feel like if this company doesn't hire you, you don't know what you'll do. Going home, I feel like you definitely, at least for me, I tend to let go of those thoughts and needs and get to see the bigger picture and realize that if you start somewhere, you're always going to end somewhere. At the end of the day, if that test or job interview doesn't end up going how you wanted it to, you will always have another opportunity in the future. Being with family and friends who support that, is great especially cause, you know, my dad has always really encouraged to follow my passion and never give up, and my sister has always been there as a role model. And my mom has always been a big encourager and supporter. So, it's great to be around that comfort and know that at the end of the day, succeed or fail, your family and friends will always support you. And secondly, they believe in you and going back to a place that really knows you and supports you, it always really fuels you up to make it through another semester."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153414633725753/?type=3,2015-12-23 10:35:11,605,22,21,605,0,0,0,0,0

Looking back I find that ridiculous for two reasons. First, you are not expected to be good at something before you have learned how to do it! The whole point of being at an educational institution is that you get to learn new things, often from scratch. You are not expected to be an expert on any topic walking into a classroom. Second, if you are not that good at a particular topic, then so what? Everyone is good at something and not as good at something else. Sometimes we limit ourselves because we fear not being good at something. I would tell my younger self to explore all of my interests and not to be concerned with how good or bad I was at something.

21105780752_10153319246090753,"""Security encompasses so many different aspects. It ranges from your laptop to your phone to even the lock on your house; security (or lack thereof) is something that not only affects a select group of people, but everyone. Everyone wants to secure something in their lives. However, not everyone knows how to secure those things they hold dear. For example, if you ask people on the street what HTTPS is, I'm sure that not many would be able to tell you much. HTTPS, in terms of network security, is the protocol that is keeping so many people's online lives (bank accounts, personal information) secure and yet, so few people know about it. I went into security not only because I found it interesting, but to help people keep their lives and those things they hold dear secure. As our world is becoming more technologically bound, more holes are appearing that let this personal and private information through. Security means thinking like someone who wants to steal this information, which is quite fascinating, because not many fields make you think like an adversary. I've chosen to think like an adversary so that not everyone has to. I've chosen to work in security so that, when you go online, you are secure. I've chosen this field because as technology becomes more and more integral in our lives, I want to make sure that the security is keeping up as well.

P.S. Don't know what HTTPS is? See the little green lock in your browser? Look it up!

21105780752_10153310332535753,"Recently I joined the University of Michigan Division of Public Safety and Security Community Outreach Unit. Our main focus is to reduce drug and alcohol harm by prevention, education and enforcement among students. In a continued effort to reduce harm, we have partnered more closely with the Ann Arbor Police Department in off-campus neighborhoods. As we educate students who are of age to consume alcohol, our main message to them is to ""stay in the blue."" We even have a ""M-Stay in the Blue"" app available for download that is a great tool for responsible drinking. We don't condone underage drinking but we would be oblivious to think that it doesn't happen, so we encourage people to check out the website ""Choose to be Safe and Legal.'' With a couple big weekends on the horizon, it is as important as ever to increase our efforts to get out tips on drinking responsibly and staying safe.

As a police officer, you always hear that you are never off duty. I believe that is also true for the education portion of being a police officer. I am always preaching to family and friends the same things I say on campus. Numerous friends have thanked me for introducing them to the ""Stay in the Blue"" app and have said they've used it while out. When we get together for the big game, there is always an abundance of food going around at my house too, especially since I have two brothers that are firemen who we all know love to cook.      

Another important message for game day is ""See Something, Say Something."" If you see suspicious behavior or a crime being committed, contact the police or person of authority immediately. This is another great tip for residents of a dorm or a close-knit neighborhood. In my neighborhood, a majority of the neighbors belong to a Facebook group that is strictly for my subdivision. It is a great tool to look out for one another and also to pass on information quickly. #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153310332535753/?type=3,2015-10-14 21:03:09,1022,20,45,1022,0,0,0,0,0

And, I walked away with the support, skills, and confidence I needed to pursue my passions without looking back.
Failing and succeeding back then, working with people from all backgrounds, game-time decisions, high-pressure environments...it was all the right preparation for the work I'm doing now with Merit and the FATE program. This work also provides me the unique opportunity to have continued interaction with U of M. I get to work with current students and witness firsthand how their Michigan experiences, like mine did, are shaping what they want to do, who they want to be. That experience, and the opportunities I've had to speak with U of M administration, faculty, staff, tons of alum, I'm constantly reminded of how amazing it is to be an alum myself, how awesome it is to be a part of the greater Michigan community, and how warm and fuzzy (and fired up) it makes me feel when someone says, 'Go Blue!'

21105780752_10153289587125753,"""My first year at Michigan was terribly difficult. I came in as a freshman wanting so badly to immediately and unconditionally love this school. The school pride is fantastic, but it can be overwhelming and stifling, especially for people who are having a difficult time on campus. I wanted to love Michigan, to call it my hoMe, but nothing I tried seemed to work. It all came to a head over winter break my first year when I finally broke down to my parents about my unhappiness. They were wonderful and supportive, and after some lengthy discussions about my future, I decided to stick it out and finish my first year.

During the next two semesters and with the start of my second year, my fortunes began to change for the better. I met and befriended wonderful people, joined some fantastic organizations and settled on my major. Now, I'm one month into my junior year, and I'm so thankful that I decided to stay here.

I now have what my freshman self could only yearn for: I love the University of Michigan. To this school and the people I have met on this journey, I owe so much of my growth into the person I have become today. I still have a long way to go, as we all do, but at the moment I am satisfied. These experiences constantly motivate me and help me to get up in the morning. They and the hopes and stories of my fellow students inspire me to do all that I can to step up, give back and improve campus to the best of my ability.

In the end, to anyone struggling to find themselves or their place here, don't worry. It won't happen overnight, but it may help to set small goals. For this year, my goal is to meet and befriend someone new each day.

Not because I am unqualified, but because each time I walk into the classroom, I feel honored that these students would sit there (most of them willingly) and work through difficult issues with me, such as imperialism, anti-Arab racism, and media stereotyping. When I lecture, I draw on my own experiences as a college student struggling to understand heady concepts. I went to an underfunded high school in a city wracked by poverty and racism in the wake of de-industrialization. I think I wrote about 12 pages of papers in my four years of high school. When I got to college, I was unprepared for most of my classes, especially History and Literature. The extent of my History classes in high school consisted of rote memorization of names and dates of European and (white) American figures and events. The scant literature we read was penned by the canonical dead men. I think I enjoyed History and Literature in college so much because it was all brand new to me. Even though it was difficult, I became a double major in History and English because it was those classes that slowly changed my worldview (and continue to do so). I love teaching for many reasons, but mostly because there is a chance that I can impact somebody's life the way many of my college professors did (and continue to do so). I also love teaching because I'm the best version of myself when I'm in front of the classroom. If you asked my students to describe my teaching style, they would probably say it's a combination of bad jokes with intense side-to-side pacing. I mean, I can wear a path in the linoleum during a 90 minute lecture. But I hope they would also appreciate that I am trying to get them to think critically about the world around them. The content of my courses is the Arab and Muslim American studies, but the message behind my teaching is applicable across the disciplines: be active consumers of information."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153279873355753/?type=3,2015-09-23 08:54:37,2138,83,174,2138,0,0,0,0,0

21105780752_10153267822375753,"""When I was 14, I walked in on someone that is very close to my heart attempting suicide. I can't begin to describe the sadness and helplessness I felt seeing that person in such despair, sadness, and hopelessness.

She is the smartest and most talented person I know, and I am grateful to say that she didn't end her life. 

So many wonderful school workers helped her, saved her, and lifted her up. They worked with her talents and her personal strengths, while also acknowledging that some things were hard for her. Depression is not something that can be cured overnight, or ""fixed"". What I witnessed was a long and hard battle - but also a powerful fight. A community of people were dedicated to lift her up, and highlight her talents to celebrate and save her.

That's what I think the University of Michigan could be - a community of talented, brilliant people lifting each other up to make sure that everyone can be highlighted, and that no one feels alone. A place where no one feels like a failure, or feels so hopeless, helpless, or trapped, that they choose to end their life.

Every year 1,100 college students end their lives. 1,100 students feel so hopeless, hurt, trapped, and alone, that they end their life. The reality is, they aren't alone.

That's what I hope Send Silence Packing shows to students - you aren't alone. I want every person to at least read 1 story on a backpack - just one! There will be stories on 200 of them. Some may sound familiar to you, others very new. Every story though, is about a friend, a brother, a sister, a daughter, a son, of someone like you. Let's talk to each other if we feel down or helpless - let's create a community accepting of each other's strengths and weaknesses, and lift each other up.

And so, right off the get go, I came to orientation without any of my friends or family near me and I just had to figure out everything on my own. It hit me right then and there that, you know, I'm alone for the next four years. Not entirely alone, but I have to function on my own for the next four years. Four years down the road, I'm almost there."" 

Why did you choose the University of Michigan?
""I wanted to go abroad to study astrophysics, which is actually what I'm doing right now. I'm doing research on black holes. I couldn't find that back home, so I had to look abroad."" #WolverinesOfAnnArbor",Wolverines of Ann Arbor,photo,https://www.facebook.com/UniversityOfMichigan/photos/a.10153189200455753.1073741840.21105780752/10153230178315753/?type=3,2015-08-26 17:44:09,463,16,19,463,0,0,0,0,0

It allows faculty teams to address major social problems too complex for a single disciplinary approach‚Äîand to pursue experimental approaches that might be too unconventional to attract immediate support from more traditional funding mechanisms.

As we learn more details about the typhoon devastation in the Philippines, the desire to help grows stronger. 

While no students or faculty were in the Philippines during this terrible storm, our thoughts are with those in the U-M community with Filipino roots or who have family and friends living in the region.

The University of Michigan Health System is working with World Medical Relief to re-purpose medical supplies and equipment for use in areas of greatest need: http://bit.ly/1apUdZu

Numerous relief agencies are working to deliver aid to the region, including the American Red Cross and UNICEF. To help, please consider supporting their work. 

The University has deep ties to the Philippines, dating back nearly 140 years, and includes helping the nation rebuild following World War II. As Filipinos look to the weeks and months ahead, our support will help further that global relationship.

Sincerely,
