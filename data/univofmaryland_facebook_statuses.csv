16972274487_10152273060874488,"Join Us for the Homecoming Pre-Party and Pep Rally on Friday, October 25th!

Dear University of Maryland friends –
Homecoming is quickly approaching during the week of October 20-26. An exciting new event will be taking place on Friday, October 25th called the Homecoming Pre-Party and Pep Rally on McKeldin Mall from 3:00-10:00 pm.  The Stamp, Fraternity & Sorority Life, University Marketing & Communications, the Athletic Department, and other campus partners have been working hard to enhance the week's events, especially as we prepare to join the Big 10 Conference. 

We hope that this new event will be an annual Homecoming tradition and will complement the spring Maryland Day as a chance to engage faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community members in an on-campus celebration.  There will be inflatables; t-shirts and other giveaways; carnival games and food;  a Greek Step Show; a pep-rally with the Marching Band, Spirit Squad and coaches;  all culminating in a fireworks display at 10:00 pm.

We invite you and your families to join us for this inaugural event.  You won't want to miss this chance to join the entire university community as we welcome alumni home and celebrate being Terps!   As a result of this exciting new program, we will not hold a Homecoming Parade this year.  For more information about the October 25th event and a full schedule of Homecoming Week activities, please visit homecoming.umd.edu.

President Loh's Message to the University of Maryland Community

August 13, 2013

Dear University of Maryland Community:

I am pleased to inform you that the final report of the President's Commission on UMD and Big Ten/CIC Integration is available at president.umd.edu/commissions/B1G.  This report will guide our University's transition into this athletic conference (on July 1, 2014) and its academic counterpart (Committee on Institutional Cooperation, on July 1, 2013). 

Implementation of the Commission's recommendations will (1) advance the excellence and reputation of UMD, (2) better support our student-athletes to perform at the highest level in their studies and in athletic competition, (3) ensure the long-term financial health of Maryland Athletics, and (4) allocate some of the Big Ten revenues to support UMD's academic mission and need-based student financial aid.  I have accepted these four principles that undergird the Commission's recommendations.

I highlight the following actions:
• Some of the new revenues expected from the Big Ten will provide our student-athletes with expanded support for academics, training, sports medicine, and nutrition. 

• Some of these new revenues will be allocated to support the University's academic priorities and student financial aid.  These allocations are expected to grow to at least $1 million annually.  Effective immediately, I have redirected $500,000 annually in other non-state revenues, previously budgeted for Maryland Athletics, to fund expanded mental health counseling services for all students. 

• After Maryland Athletics achieves financial stability, half of its excess revenues will be used to repay its debts and the other half will be set aside to build its financial reserves.  This is to ensure that Maryland Athletics, which is a self-supporting enterprise, will never again be in a position where it has to cut teams. 

• The men's outdoor track and field team will be restored with the full allotment of scholarship support.  

• The Commission left open the possibility of reinstating other teams in the future.  Any reinstatement review will be informed by the aforementioned principles of the Commission. 

• UMD will produce high-quality academic, research, and athletic programming for the Big Ten Network that reaches some 80 million households in the U.S. and abroad.
There is more that I would like to do, and plan to do, to support athletics, academics, and student financial aid.  At this time, however, I am constrained by the Atlantic Coast Conference's withholding of UMD's rightful athletic revenues, which are the main funding source for our athletic programs.  Maryland Athletics now must borrow from other UMD (non-state) funds for operating expenses during our remaining time of ACC membership.  While I cannot comment specifically because litigation with the ACC is underway, I can say that our long-term planning has taken into account these issues.  I am resolved to shield our student-athletes from any permanent impact.

Joining the Big Ten is about academics as well as athletics.  I am pleased to report that many of our faculty, students, and staff are already participating in CIC programs on education, research, technology commercialization, libraries, student government, student affairs, and campus safety.  They have been warmly welcomed by their counterparts in this consortium of top-ranked flagship and AAU research universities.  Joining this ""super-university"" will advance UMD's academic mission. 

I am grateful to the 23 members of the Commission and to the additional faculty, staff and administrators who supported the Commission's work during its six months of data gathering, deliberations, and public forums that resulted in the excellent report.  These members represent key constituencies: University Senate, undergraduate and graduate student government, UMCP Foundation Board of Trustees, Alumni Association, Student-Athlete Advisory Council, Terrapin Club, and M-Club.  My special thanks to the co-chairs, Linda Clement (Vice President for Student Affairs) and Barry Gossett (vice-chair, University System of Maryland Board of Regents).  

I welcome your comments at president@umd.edu.

Thank you for your continued support of the University of Maryland.

Sincerely,

Wallace D. Loh

16972274487_10101196095292298,"Duke's Tree: Goodbye, Old Friend

A majestic white oak that has served for decades as a campus landmark has reached the end of its life and will be removed Aug. 1.
   The tree, alternately known as the Chapel Oak or Duke's Tree (honoring a former groundskeeper who tended it for 34 years), stands due east of Memorial Chapel overlooking Route 1 and is estimated to be 80 years old. Its trunk measures 62 inches across.
   The university's Arboretum and Horticultural Services staff has closely monitored the declining health of the Chapel Oak for several years and tried different methods to help the tree absorb water and nutrients better and to ward off pests, says Karen Petroff, assistant director. But a lightning strike last fall damaged the main trunk, and pests and pathogens that seek out damaged trees attacked the white oak in force.
   Today, the tree is clearly in distress; all of its leaves have turned a light shade of brown and once vibrant branches now look brittle. University Arborist Josh Nadler sought the opinion of two outside tree experts before deciding to have the Chapel Oak removed.
   ""It had become a public safety hazard and we needed to address that before something unfortunate happened,"" says Nadler.
   White oaks, technically known as Quercus alba, are the state's official tree and are closely related to the willow oaks that gracefully line McKeldin Mall. The Chapel Oak is one of about 60 white oaks on campus; more than 8,500 trees and large shrubs are spread out over its 1,250 acres.
   University carpenters plan to salvage pieces of the Chapel Oak after it is cut down, and depending on the quality of the wood, may construct a small desk or other memento to be displayed in the Visitor Center.
   ""We fully understand the tree is a campus landmark, with many alumni and visitors telling us stories of meeting there or even getting engaged there,"" says Petroff.
   The university tentatively plans to plant a replacement tree in the same spot, possibly during Homecoming Weekend in October.",Duke's Tree,video,https://www.facebook.com/UnivofMaryland/videos/10101196095292298/,2012-07-23 17:38:30,51,20,46,51,0,0,0,0,0

The Veterans Student Life Office, as part of the university's Veterans Initiative, seeks to be a resource and advocate to help student veterans address these challenges, such as securing housing, benefits and financial aid and getting health care and counseling. 

This week, as Veterans Day approaches on Nov. 11, we're profiling three student veterans and service members to showcase how they're succeeding at Maryland, and to honor the sacrifices of a valued population at the university.
