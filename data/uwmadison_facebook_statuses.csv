The suspect was described as a white male, approximately 20 years of age, average build, 5'9""-6'1"", wearing a dark windbreaker-type jacket, jeans, and a dark stocking hat.  Suspect displayed a knife before taking the victim's laptop and cash. The suspect fled on foot on the bike path towards the Kohl Center and the victim was not injured.

At night it is best to walk in groups or make use of the University's Safe Walk services – call 262-5000.  If ever confronted by an individual with a weapon, give up your property and don't resist.  If you see anyone exhibiting suspicious behavior or criminal behavior, immediately call 911.

The City of Madison Police Department is investigating this case.  If anyone has any information about the crime listed above contact the Madison Police Department at (608) 266-4948.
