As result of the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), designed to protect the educational records of students, Indiana University is not able to publicly comment on individual student misconduct cases, including the final disposition of those cases. Additionally, it would be inappropriate for the university to comment on the outcome of a criminal judicial proceeding to which it is not a party.
 
As it relates to sexual misconduct, however, the university continues to utilize robust processes that are designed to support victims, while at the same time affording due process to those accused of misconduct. In instances where a student is found responsible for committing an act of sexual violence, the penalty is suspension or expulsion.
 
Additionally, the university regularly engages in a broad range of educational communication and programming to students, faculty and staff regarding sexual assault. The university's goals are both to prevent sexual assault whenever possible and to support the victims to the fullest extent possible.

""My fondest memory from IU is IUDM 2015, the fourth and final IU Dance Marathon event that I participated in as an undergrad. The 36-hour event that took place last October was a culmination of every ounce of passion, dedication, and heart that all 4,000 student members had put into fundraising for Riley Hospital throughout the year. At the end of the event we raised a total of $3.88 million dollars benefitting the children at Riley Hospital. Seeing that total and knowing that that was the conclusion of my time as a student leader with IUDM, was the most fulfilling and rewarding experience I've ever had.

As a lifelong Hoosier fan, Indiana University has had a significant impact on me since childhood. Despite knowing how special of a place this is, I still never could have imagined graduating from IU with the level of experience, purpose, or passion that this university has provided me.""

Student success depends upon more than the content of individual courses or the curriculum of particular degree programs.
 
An important part of it is conditioned by an environment that provides support in other ways, from student organizations that encourage personal and social growth; to services that support the physical and mental health and wellness of students; to physical environments that are safe and inspiring; and to building a community in which diversity of community and ideas is valued and in which all members of the community are committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity.
 
Indiana University's longstanding commitment to embracing diversity in the broadest sense is also fundamental to student success.
 
The Bicentennial Strategic Plan embodies that commitment as a core value, and, in light of recent events at other universities that have made national headlines, let me take a moment this evening to underscore and reaffirm Indiana University's unwavering commitment to diversity and free expression.
 
As part that commitment, we recruit students and faculty from diverse cultural backgrounds.
 
We strive to ensure that cultural diversity is well represented in the curriculum.
 
And we seek to ensure that members of our community who come from diverse backgrounds interact with one another in educationally purposeful ways.

For through continued interaction with others who hold views that differ from our own‚Äîwhose life experiences are vastly different from ours‚Äîour minds are opened to new ways of understanding.
 
We comprehend, we empathize, we learn.
 
We must, all of us, bend our efforts‚Äîevery day, and not just in the wake of a particular incident‚Äîto assure that our university community regards tolerance and tolerant diversity and the free expression of ideas as among its core values.
 
The Bicentennial Campaign will help us to continue to broaden and strengthen a culture of diversity on all IU campuses.",,status,,2015-11-12 18:12:15,164,5,51,164,0,0,0,0,0

It was also hard seeing so many other veterans, who are far worse off than I am, struggle with every step of the compensation process. I found a job posting from IU law professor Carwina Weng asking for assistance with a disability law clinic she was hosting through the Maurer School of Law. Soon after accepting the position, I began establishing a veteran's clinic for disabled veterans, the first to be created in a law school in Indiana. Now, we are proudly accepting veterans for our disability assistance program, which allows students to get hands-on experience in the field while helping benefit the veterans in the community.

The positive energy and excitement associated with the early weeks of a new academic year on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington has been sadly and abruptly shattered this week, as tragedy struck the campus twice in a very public fashion with the untimely deaths of two promising students.

Yaolin Wang was a junior transfer student who had just begun her IU journey this fall, but who already had immersed herself in the Bloomington campus community, while Joseph Smedley II was a sophomore biochemistry major from Indianapolis who had many friends on campus.

Any time a student dies, the entire campus community is diminished, and to lose two students in a span of days multiplies our collective grief and sense of mourning. To the family and friends of Yaolin and Joseph, I extend our deepest sympathies on behalf of the entire Indiana University family. Our thoughts and prayers are with you in this time of unfathomable sorrow and loss.

To students who feel they need some extra support in dealing with these tragic events, resources are available to help. IU Counseling and Psychological Services has counselors available around-the-clock and I would encourage you to make use of this service by calling (812) 855-5711 and selecting option 1.

There is no way to prepare for the sudden and premature loss of life that has occurred in our community this week. The best we can do, perhaps, is to support one another and make the time to the cherish our friends and loved ones every day.

Again, our heartfelt sympathies go out to the family and friends of Yaolin Wang and Joseph Smedley, both of whom have left us far too early.",,status,,2015-10-03 14:10:26,200,26,49,200,0,0,0,0,0

I write to you now about two sad events in the IU Bloomington community‚Äîthe tragic death of Yaolin Wang, a junior from the People's Republic of China, and the disappearance of Joseph Smedley II, a sophomore from Indianapolis, who was reported missing on Monday.

Yaolin had just turned 21 years old. She had only been on the IU Bloomington campus since this fall, having transferred from North Seattle Community College to study at the Kelley School of Business. Our hearts go out to her friends and family at this time, and I hope you will keep them in your thoughts and prayers.

A City of Bloomington Police Department investigation is still underway, but police have confirmed that this was an isolated event that poses no threat to our students.

Indiana University police continue to investigate the disappearance of Joseph Smedley II, 20, whose last known communication was a text message to a family member on Monday. Flyers with Joseph's description and photo (see below) are also being distributed around Bloomington, and anyone with information about his whereabouts is urged to contact IU Police at (812) 855-3499.

All of us who are part of the IU community are deeply troubled and concerned by these recent events. During such difficult moments, it is truly heartening to see the outpouring of care and support from students, faculty and staff and to know that we can find strength in one another.

If any of our students feel overwhelmed with distress or would like help processing these events, students may see a counselor at IU Counseling and Psychological Services on the 4th floor of the IU Health Center. After-hours phone service is also available, free of charge, at (812) 855-5711 (select option 1).

Please be safe and take care of one another.

Hannah Wilson was a beloved daughter, sister, and granddaughter. She was a cherished and treasured friend to her sorority sisters and many others here in Bloomington, at her home in Fishers, and around the country.

Her loss disorders the moral universe and breaks the heart of our community. We join with all of Indiana University in sending our deepest and most profound sympathy to her family. Our thoughts are also with the many IU students, staff, and faculty who loved and taught Hannah, and who join in mourning her.

Hannah was a gifted student, who two weeks from now would have been graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology, which she hoped to use in service to others. She brought great light to our community, and her strong and continuing impact is clear from the outpouring of grief during the past few days.

Our campus has joined together to honor her memory in gatherings, large and small, since the moment of the tragic news of her death. Our deep bonds as a community are evident in the many ways we have determined to honor Hannah by showing each other strong support and kindness in the wake of this horrible loss.

It is difficult, and perhaps impossible, to understand a loss like this. But we will continue to stand together as a community and support each other during this difficult time.

If you or a friend feels overwhelmed with distress, we urge you to see a counselor during the day at IU Counseling and Psychological Services on the 4th floor of the IU Health Center. After-hours crisis phone service is also available, free of charge, at 812-855-5711 (select option 1).

However, after eight months of displaying such information on the campus home page, http://www.iub.edu, the decision was made to rotate the ""find Lauren"" button with other information on the web site.

For now, the ""find Lauren"" button will be displayed constantly on the
site the first week of each month. It also will be in a steady rotation of
other news and information items displayed on site. In addition, IU
Communications, which administers the site, has designed two new buttons in the hope that a fresh look will continue to draw attention to this important item.

As it has from the beginning, the entire IU community supports the
Spierer family as it seeks a resolution to this tragic situation and will
continue to help in any way it can. These changes to the IU Bloomington
web site in no way diminish the university's commitment to finding Lauren but rather are an attempt to balance the desire to support the Spierer family with the need to provide a wide range of news and information to all its students and other stakeholders via the campus web site.""",Indiana University Bloomington,link,http://iub.edu/,2012-02-04 19:16:22,101,43,11,101,0,0,0,0,0
