From experience, I can say I truly lucked out with how good Eat At State | Michigan State University is. Visiting other schools, I found that they weren't nearly as diverse and accommodating to different dietary restrictions as MSU. 

Since recently moving off campus, I'm realizing how nice it was to have ready-made meals available to me until midnight every day. Now that I'm preparing my own meals, I especially miss the Gallery, my favorite cafeteria on campus, located in Snyder-Phillips. Those sugar cookies on football game days?

From the lifelong friends I made, crises I endured, and life-changing experiences I had, it's safe to say MSU shaped me into the person who's going to walk across that stage. I will carry the lessons I learned at this university with me every day.

This year, I have so much to write about, it feels like I'm giving myself a class assignment. Michigan State is full of opportunities, and I am taking advantage of many of them.

From Bachelor Mondays and venting with my roommates to being an expert on this city, living in East Lansing has been the best experience a college girl could ask for. 

As bittersweet as moving away will be, I'm so glad that my last living experience here was such a great one. I will always think back with a smile on the memories that my roommates and I made in our house, and I hope we keep in touch in the years to come.

I've chosen to (hopefully!) study at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. Seeing as I never pursued learning an additional language, the U.K. seems like a good fit for me. Also, the university itself is in a great location, near the city, coast and countryside. 

On another note, I can't wait to meet more people in my Doctor Who fandom! 

MSU has so many opportunities to customize your study abroad experience, and by choosing my location, I am one step closer to becoming a world traveler.

Spartans, have you studied abroad in the U.K.? What about elsewhere in the world?

When applying for schools, MSU was one of my first options, but I was intimidated by its size. RCAH gave me the opportunity to go to MSU and have all of the advantages of a major university, like awesome study abroad opportunities and sporting events, but still get the feel of a smaller college. 

Through the residential college, my passion for civic engagement has been supported and has had the chance to thrive. I have so many people to thank for my great learning experience at MSU. First in this line is Dean Esquith for creating the environment that I love to live and learn in.

This semester, I even had the opportunity to travel with the team to Indianapolis to take part in the College Improv Tournament. We got 22 minutes to perform in front of an audience and three judges at a comedy club in the city. We didn't win, but I already know it's going to be one of my favorite memories from being here at Michigan State.

I'm thankful to have thousands of fellow students to put my arms around when I hear the first notes of the MSU alma mater—and for the immense pride I will always feel when I hear that song. 

I'm thankful for Sparty and his one-armed pushups and for the goosebumps the Spartan Marching Band gives me when it plays the best fight song there is.

Later, when I saw him taking in the game a few rows behind me, I couldn't help but run over and snag a photo. Seeing Coach Izzo, who is such an important figure in the MSU community, sit among thousands of students has to be one of my favorite Spartan moments thus far. 

By keeping his promise, it shows how much he values and appreciates us, in or out of Breslin. It's nice to know we have a down-to-earth (and not to mention photogenic) coach who's willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of his biggest fans.

I was away at college and didn't really know what to do. I didn't have time to visit my family doctor, but I knew there was place I could go called the Olin Health Center. I set up an appointment, met with a nurse practitioner, was prescribed some medication, and I slowly started to get better.

The staff members at Olin were great, and it was really reassuring to know that there was somewhere on campus I could go to be taken care of and treated.

I walked past Beaumont today and stopped for a moment to listen to the tower chime.

During these next few months, I'm going to take the time to stop and enjoy the things I love about MSU.

She also shared a laugh with the FRIB laboratory director, Konrad Gelbke, before her speech.
 
In her remarks, President Simon noted that this partnership is a great example of ""a way that we must work together as a sort of 'Team Michigan.'""
 
After the event, President Simon asked if I needed a quote or any other remarks from her. I said no and mentioned that her quote about ""Team Michigan"" was really awesome. She laughed, patted me on the arm, and said, ""Well, I was trying to make your job a little easier today."" If that didn't just make my day, I don't know what else could!

While sitting there snapping photos and taking notes, I realized even more how many hats the president wears and the variety of duties that she performs for both our academic and athletic communities. As a student, I feel like organizing my life and keeping track of my own agenda is difficult. She puts a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm into the work she does every day—she's approaching superhero status in my book.

There were tons of students there along with MSU administrators and local leaders.

I listened as President Simon chatted with food science and economics sophomore Dominic Nangea (left) and premed sophomore Kuya Julius (right), both from Kenya. They showed off the sticks they were holding, which symbolize peace and leadership in their culture. Afterward, they told me how cool it was that the president came up and spoke with them and how they're looking forward to getting to know her.
 
Before President Simon delivered the opening address, I got a chance to talk with her about how cool this event is. She mentioned how we want our MSU students studying abroad to feel welcome in their new homes and how this event is ""a way of doing that for our international students—not only on campus but in our community.""
 
I thought that was really something special. As Spartans, we welcome everyone with open arms. It's events like this that really separate us from everyone else.

The two talked about working together to connect Lansing, East Lansing, and other surrounding communities.
 
The discussion that stuck out the most to me was the idea to get the cities of Lansing and East Lansing more involved in welcoming Michigan State University's freshmen to the mid-Michigan region. The surrounding communities are so important to a lot of us here at MSU. I think getting the community more involved in welcoming our new Spartans would be an awesome way to start out the school year.

Her words made me feel even more proud to go to a school that has stayed true to itself over the years.

President Simon was surprised when I said that I'd never been to the the Ag Expo before. I wish I would've visited in previous years-- it's a pretty big deal here at MSU!
