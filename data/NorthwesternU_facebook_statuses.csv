Q: "" How does your theatre major help you to become a better human being?""
A: ""As Prof. David Catlin put it, and I am paraphrasing here, 'To study or to do theatre is to investigate what it is to be a human being'. I think doing theatre means you can apply it to anything. It gives you a strong sense of compassion for other people. Every character that I played, I have tried to understand them, to think how they will think. It teaches you a lot about putting yourself in other people's shoes and that applies anywhere you go in life.""

Q: "" What are the challenges you faced here?""
A: ""Managing my time and my mental balance. I think it is a common thing at Northwestern for students to take on a lot. My peers are so capable and we take on too much and we manage to do it all. That takes a lot of time. So I become good managing myself and also realizing I need to see good friends that are important to me, to eat a good meal and to go for a run by the lake. It is really easy to lose sight of these things when you are doing so much. That's important but the smaller things are important, too. By the end of senior year I am realizing that more and more.""

Q: ""How do you rate your social life here at NU?""
A: ""I think it is very subjective but at Northwestern most students have been able to find a community that they feel they belong to. For me it is not just one community. I feel like I have different groups of people where I fit in. I worked at the Northwestern Phonathon and that is a very exciting and awesome group of people that are very outgoing and diverse. There is the student community here, which is overwhelmingly generous with their time. We just made a lot of theatre together and everyone goes to see each other in their productions. I was also really lucky to visit the NU campus on Doha. The students on the trip I went with were a nice community. They are mostly film, communication studies and journalism students. That's where I made lots of friends. It's been really great to find different niches that I feel I am not just in one place. I really like that.""

Q: ""Do you have any questions you want to ask other students on campus?""
A : "" Hmm, OK, have you guys figured out what to do with your life? Cause I don't necessarily know. What I do know is what I like to study and what I like to do. I don't necessarily know how that is going to translate into a career. I have skills from everything I have done here at Northwestern. So I am just gonna find somewhere those skills are useful and look for ways to make art and to do the stuff I like to do. Hopefully I will be able to do all of that which will also pay the bills.""

228401243342_10152537778413343,"Here's another post in our collaboration with People of NU to feature stories from seniors in the Northwestern Class of 2014. Meet senior twins Valentina Garces and Manuela Garces.

Q: ""What are your majors?""

A: ""Both of our majors are communication studies with minors in economics and we will both do a one year master program of management studies in Kellogg after graduation. We are following the same tracks.""

Q: ""Do you have any special powers as twins?""

A: ""We can read each other's mind just by looking at each other. For example if she looked the other way I will know what she was trying to tell me. We have the same cues and primers. She can start a sentence, stop in the middle and I will be able to finish the rest.""

Q: ""What were the funniest experiences when growing up as twins?""

A: ""When we were little we took each other's test and we switched classes. I was in a gifted class and she wanted to try it out because she was going to be there too. So I switched class with her. The principal only found out 6 months later. And she laughed and laughed and who sold us out were another pair of twins who were our best friends.""

Q: ""What was it like to have a twin sister on campus?""

A: ""We were always together. We have been roommates since the junior year. We really like studying in the same place. It just helps when you have someone by your side to remind you what the professor said in the class.""

Q: ""Who helped you the most on campus?""

A: ""It has to be Debra Webster our academic adviser from School of Communication. She is like a second mom to us. Whenever we feel stressed we will go to her and she will calm us down and help us out."" 

Q: ""What is the best advice she ever gave you?""

A: ""The best advice she gave us is to follow our passion. She used to say, 'Do not do everything just because your classmates or friends do. Always challenge yourself but also take into account your passion.'""

Q: ""What advice do you want to give to people who are not twins?""

A: ""They might feel a little bit alienated when they are around us. Because we have this special connection, we can talk to each other just by looking at each other or showing little gestures and they do not know how to deal with it. But since being together all the time and having this special bond, as twins we are actually more open and receptive than normal people. So just talk to us and do not feel freaked out.""

Q: ""Who inspired you on campus?""
A: ""I would like to say some of the professors, but I think some of the students that were older than me were really my role models.""

Q: ""Do you have any advice you would give to your younger self?""
A: ""That's so difficult. I think when things get hard, it is easier when you're doing them with friends. For any kind of challenge, doing hard things with friends makes them easier.""

Q: ""What was you biggest challenge in your time here?""
A: ""I was in a sorority and I was on the sailing team too. Splitting my time between those was really hard because I loved them both a lot. But I cared about them both so much that splitting my time was worth it. Even though I was really busy, it was okay because it was with things I was passionate about.""

Q: ""Anything else you want to add?""
A: ""Do what makes you happy and keep doing it!""

Q: ""What is something you are proud of in you time here at NU?""

A: ""My senior year, I was one of the co-chairs of Green Cup. It's something I'm passionate about which is environmental sustainability, both education and action. We were able to save the university thousands of dollars on energy reductions which I think is really cool. It was a fun opportunity for me to manage a large group of people with a shared vision.""

Q: ""Do you plan on taking anything you've learned from that into your future post-graduation life?""
A: ""That's a great question. I'll be essentially doing professional Green Cup starting on Monday, working at a firm called Goby in city. They do energy and sustainability consulting for commercial real estate.""

Q: ""Do you have one piece of advice for new students?""

A: ""For anyone who really wants to get the most out of their time both at Northwestern and in Life, from my limited experience, I would say sit yourself down and ask yourself the following questions:

1) What makes you unique?
2) What makes you happy?
3) What is a problem in the world that you want to work to solve?
4) Are you currently doing things in your life that make you happy and that solve those problems?

And I want you to write down those questions and your answers in a big bold marker and tape them above your desk so you can look at them every single day. And I promise you that if you look at those answers everyday and ask yourself am I doing these things? You'll find that you will be a happier and more disciplined person and you will be leading a much more meaningful life.""

228401243342_10152520835133343,"Here's the third in our collaboration with People of NU to feature stories from seniors in the Northwestern Class of 2014. Meet Weinberg senior Zoe Palmer.

Q: ""What is your proudest moment so far on campus?""

A: ""My proudest moment as a student on campus was doing my senior reading! I wrote fiction as part of creative writing sequence.I am a senior with double majors in creative writing and cognitive science, and yes, I know that's a weird combination. Think of it as two different ways to study people. Likewise I wrote weird fiction published in Every Day Fiction, Prompt, and forthcoming in Swamp Biscuits and Tea.""

Q: ""How does the experience here at Northwestern help you to become a writer?""

A: ""To become a writer you have to do it every day. Writing is not something you could dip in and out. The classes I took here keep me doing it all the time. The trick is to read a lot and keep at it to find your inspirations. You also learn rules of writing by reading a lot.""

Q: ""What are the basic rules you have to know to become a great writer?""

A: ""Some of the basic rules are—to make it exciting—your character has to have some stakes. They have to want something or something has to be interfering with what they want. Otherwise it is not a story, it is just a chronicle of events. At sentence level, vary your sentence length and structure and keep it away from getting boring. Another piece of advice I guess I would say is to pay attention to real life, pay attention really closely to the world around you. You never know if you might observe a very interesting detail that might make a great note in the story, or you see a really interesting person that will make a great character. Cause real life is full of little wired incongruities, and those make great elements of a story.""

Q: ""What's one piece of advice you'd share with others?""

A: ""Don't let other people, kind of, put you down or tell you that you can't do something because I think for me, I'm a Creative Writing and Bio double major, it's like really weird. And a lot of people told me at the beginning that, you know like, why would you do that? Or, like, you can't do that, that's so much. Or they don't make sense together...I just don't believe in that. I think that if you really want to do everything, you can. I'm a photographer and a writer, I volunteer... I do a lot of stuff and it's never taken away from my experience in any way. It's only made me feel like a more full human being.""

Q: ""What was your hardest decision at Northwestern?""

A: ""Oh man, to change my major and not be able to graduate on time. I switched out of Bienen to McCormick when I was so close to finishing the degree. Like it would've almost been a formality to finish there, and a lot of people were pressuring me to do that. For me it was a great decision--well maybe not financially--but in general if you stay longer people kind of see that as a failure. Like it's pretty rare not to graduate on time and if you don't it's probably because of some extenuating circumstances. But I can't say that, I was just doing one thing and, like, a completely new idea bashed me over the head and I just ran with it."" -Kyle
