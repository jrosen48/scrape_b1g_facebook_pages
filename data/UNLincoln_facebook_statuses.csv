He created an open learning lab for students called Maker Hours, helped develop an interdisciplinary minor in informatics and serves on the Publications Board of the Daily Nebraskan.

A screen capture of a Facebook exchange has been circulating on social media, and as common as that is, in this particular case it warrants this note.
 
In this exchange, one person, whose name is listed as Joey Simpson, uses derogatory and racist language. Another person asks:  ""Aren't you affiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln?""
 
The answer is no. No one named Joey Simpson is a student, faculty member or on the staff of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Further, we condemn the use of such language in any forum as it only serves to communicate disrespect.
 
This is an opportune time to remind all in the university community that you can share matters that you feel need to be elevated or addressed via the TIPS Incident Reporting System. A link to TIPS appears in the footer of every page on the UNL website.

To prevent heat illness, fans attending Saturday's game should:

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Drink lots of water. Avoid drinking liquids that contain alcohol or large amounts of sugar, which cause the loss of more body fluid. Avoid very cold drinks because they can cause stomach cramps.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Minimize direct contact with the sun. Try to rest often in shady areas.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Snack regularly, rather than eating heavy meals. Consider eating light, cool, easy-to-digest foods such as fruit or salads.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing.

‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Fans can bring two sealed or empty water bottles (under 20oz) and refill at fountains on the concourses of Memorial Stadium.

The matchup between the two schools, to be known as ""The Heroes Game,"" will benefit non-profit organizations doing ""incredible good"" in the heartland.

Hy-Vee is proud to be the title sponsor of the yearly meeting between the University of Iowa and University of Nebraska football teams ‚Äì a Big Ten Conference rivalry that has been dubbed ""The Heroes Game."" This annual rivalry benefits the American Red Cross, an organization doing ""incredible good"" in the heartland.

The ""Heroes Game,"" scheduled for the Friday after Thanksgiving, pits conference powerhouses Iowa and Nebraska in what promises to become an epic battle for bragging rights in the nation's heartland. The two teams will be playing for more than a trophy, however; with the help of Hy-Vee, they will use the national stage created by the game to recognize individuals for acts of heroism in their communities.

In advance of the game, fans of each school will be encouraged to nominate everyday citizens of Iowa and Nebraska who deserve to be honored for extraordinary acts of heroism. One citizen-hero from each state will be invited to attend the game as a special guest of the teams, receive on-field recognition, and have his or her name inscribed on the game trophy.

In addition, UI and NU officials are counting on the intense interest in the big game to help raise money for the American Red Cross as they continue doing heroic work in the two states. Hy-Vee stores in Iowa and Nebraska will spearhead the fundraising effort by creating activities designed to engage and excite fans of each school.

7293092326_10151112890812327,"In honor of all of the men and women who have served in the military, we salute you.

In the fall of 1922, a drive for $430,000 in funds to build a new football stadium was undertaken by faculty, students, alumni and friends of the university. Designed by John Latenser, Sr., a notable Omaha architect, the stadium was named Memorial Stadium to honor all Nebraskans who served in the Civil and Spanish-American Wars and the 751 Nebraskans who died in World War I. Later, the stadium would also honor the 3,839 Nebraskans who died in World War II; the 225 in Korea; and the 422 in Vietnam. Construction was completed in just over 90 working days; Memorial Stadium was dedicated on October 20, 1923.

Inscribed on the four corners of the stadium are the following words, written by former Nebraska professor of philosophy Hartley Burr Alexander:

Southeast: ""In Commemoration of the men of Nebraska who served and fell in the Nation's Wars.""

Southwest: ""Not the victory but the action; Not the goal but the game; In the deed the glory.""

Northwest: ""Courage; Generosity; Fairness; Honor; In these are the true awards of manly sport.""

Northeast: ""Their Lives they held their country's trust; They kept its faith; They died its heroes.""",,status,,2012-11-10 17:13:27,931,25,97,931,0,0,0,0,0

Burkhead Bulls No. 13 Huskers Past No. 9 Spartans

Lincoln - Rex Burkhead put on an offensive display with three touchdowns and 157 all-purpose yards to power No. 13 Nebraska to a 24-3 pounding of No. 9 Michigan State at Memorial Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

With the victory, Nebraska improved to 7-1 overall and 3-1 in the Big Ten, while handing the Spartans (6-2, 3-1) their first conference loss of the year. The Huskers pulled even with MSU in the Legends Division standings, while also notching their second win over an Associated Press top-10 team in the past two seasons under Coach Bo Pelini.","Nebraska (24) vs Mich.
