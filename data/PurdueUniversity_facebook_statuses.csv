""As we've already indicated, a threat of rape is outside the bounds of any definition of protected speech. And if it appeared that Mr. Newman had any such intention, he would have been terminated immediately. But the police investigation tells us that there was, and is, no real threat to the campus community.  That finding does not foreclose the possibility of other employment-related actions based on Purdue's internal complaint processes.

""The disruption we've endured as a community is entirely due to Mr. Newman's online posts.  Anything other than a full apology and explanation from him about the intent of his statement will be insufficient to cure the harm he's done.

""It's fortunate for Mr. Newman that he works at a public university both obligated under the First Amendment and committed by principle to protect free speech -- even speech as abhorrent as his.  Had he uttered such an outrageous and vulgar statement while working for a private college or other private employer, he would almost certainly have been fired on the spot.  Mr. Newman's obnoxious rhetoric is an embarrassment for Purdue, but our special obligations as a public institution impose a much higher threshold before condemnation can be extended to punishment.""",,status,,2016-02-12 18:01:09,203,213,96,203,0,0,0,0,0

Cohen, who was on his way to ROTC training, saw the smoke before any first responders had arrived. He quickly began waking those in the burning building so they could evacuate. Thedans arrived on the scene shortly afterward and helped. Their quick thinking, actions and courage ensured that the tragedy was not made worse.

On Thursday, President Daniels presented the One Brick Higher Award to them, which is given to people who go above and beyond the call of duty. 

Cody Day, 22, was killed in the fire. He was a Connersville resident who was not enrolled at Purdue and was visiting friends. Student Chase Woodall was injured in the fire and remains hospitalized at an Eskenazi Health facility in Indianapolis.

Jay Melosh, a Purdue distinguished professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences, stands in front of a map showing the moon's gravity field. As a member of the science team of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission, Melosh led a study of large concentrations of mass beneath the lunar surface. The team confirmed that the mass concentrations, or ""mascons,"" were caused by massive asteroid impacts billions of year ago and determined how these impacts changed the density of material on the moon's surface and, in turn, its gravity field.
