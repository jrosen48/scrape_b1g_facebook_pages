The Illinois Art Education Association named Anne Sautman the 2016 Museum Art Educator of the Year ‚Äî for the second time. The first came shortly before she left the Art Institute of Chicago education department a decade ago to take her position at Krannert.

There, Sautman oversees public and school programs, among them KAM-WAM ‚Äî Krannert Art Museum-Week at the Museum ‚Äî which she started in 2011. In it, public elementary school students spend a week at the museum, learning about art and engaging in cross-curriculum lessons. The museum also offers KAM-BAM, in which students spend a full day at the museum with intensive lessons around a single theme.

Sautman also teaches the UI undergraduate course, Museums in Action, for students in art education. She's so deserving of recognition, and WAM-KAM is so needed to introduce young children to the pleasures and meanings of visual art.

This method, called smart Monte Carlo or biased random walk, can be explained in terms of evolution: Random mutations occur, but there's a bias toward those mutations that improve survival, since the lethal mutations won't get passed on.

At the London Games, in 2012, athletes from the University of Illinois brought home 10 of the 28 medals. Seven of them were gold. Other U.S. schools -- including the University of Arizona, Arizona State and Penn State University -- offer the sport, but none has yet reached the same level of success.

""It's a dominant program,"" says Cathy Sellers, high-performance director for U.S. Paralympics Track and Field. ""In fact, I don't think there's another program in the United States for any sport that is as dominant as the University of Illinois is in Paralympic track and field.""",Why the fastest women in the world wheel through Illinois cornfields,link,http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/17474397/why-fastest-women-world-wheel-illinois-cornfields,2016-09-08 08:57:00,614,10,96,571,34,9,0,0,0

""In 1991, with just a few hundred dollars to our name, my family and I immigrated to the United States from the USSR, and landed in Chicago a couple of days after I turned 16 years old.

Coming from a family of scientists, I was always strongly encouraged to seek out the best education available. Graduating high school in 1993, I went to study Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of America's best schools in the discipline.

The Internet's popularity had just begun to explode, opportunities were limitless, and everyone around me was dreaming up startup company ideas. I started no fewer than four companies while finishing up my degree, and every single one of them failed. Undeterred, I drove cross-country to Silicon Valley, and co-founded my fifth company -- PayPal.

Recruiting as many college friends as I could to join the venture, the next few years were spent building the foundation of what is now a $45 billion company, employing over nearly 17,000 people.

Because of PayPal's success, I was afforded the opportunity to support and fuel the start of many other great companies. I was able to co-found Glow and Affirm, and I was the first investor and chairman of Yelp -- a company that now employs more than 4,000 people. I've served on corporate boards of Yahoo!, Yelp, and Evernote, as well as the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Advisory Board. I've had the privilege to invest in over 100 startups, and advise numerous others.

I believe that the most promising entrepreneurs from around the world should have the same opportunity I had -- the chance to deliver on their potential, here in America.""",Email to The White House from Max Levchin: The next great immigrant inventor,link,https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/26/email-max-levchin,2016-09-03 10:42:00,174,3,20,160,14,0,0,0,0

""I realized that I could learn a lot about ethnic and race relations by exploring the history of Tanzania,"" said Neville, who noted that the country is one of the few in Africa that has not experienced large-scale ethnic violence or civil war since becoming an independent nation. ""As a scholar and someone committed to social justice, I'm interested in better understanding environments that promote intergroup harmony.""

""One of the potential applications is for surgeons performing tumor removal. It's difficult for a surgeon to determine which tissues are still cancerous: should they take it out or leave it? In certain cases, this can be extremely crucial. Our system can measure the tissue and say if it's healthy or not. It's a really big deal, especially if you think about brain cancer where every little millimeter removed is important. That's crucial.""

""In the cancer community, we need more precise diagnosis, so there will be less treatments applied to misdiagnosis. This can prevent stress and spending money unnecessarily.

At only 12 weeks old, Butch, a boxer, was brought to the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital with a broken right front leg. His owner at the time said Butch hurt himself rough housing with other dogs. The only options were an expensive fix or amputation and neutering. 
 
Butch could still move around freely, but over time, the added stress from putting all of his weight on three legs instead of four could lead to injuries. 
 
That's where a group of Mechanical Science and Engineering at UIUC students came in.
 
A team of nine undergraduate students, formed out of the Biomedical Engineering Society, created a custom orthotic to take some of the pressure off of Butch's legs.
 
""Dogs put a lot of weight on their front legs so over time that would manifest as injuries in joints,"" said Varun Jain, a junior in mechanical engineering. ""Our orthotic is a precaution that mitigates that risk of injury over time.""
 
The nature of Butch's injury meant he had no residual limb that could be used for a prosthetic attachment, so the solution was a two-joint orthotic, added to his remaining front leg, that would take the pressure off of all his legs and prevent long-term injuries. The device looks like a brace, similar to that on a person with an ACL injury.

In addition to facilitating scientific research, he also wants to inspire more people to lead active lifestyles.

""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said about the climb. ""There are a number of people who question why I'm going, and honestly, I don't know why. But ever since I went the last time, I want the summit, and to be the oldest man who's ever done so. I think it's significant that people who have had cardiac events have options that they may not have thought possible.""

""I found an article that talked about this hotel in Toronto and when refugees come, they live in the hotel for two months. During spring break, I googled this hotel and I just went there. I told the lady in charge of immigration services that I'd like to volunteer and help out. She was like, 'Since you're only here for a week we'd have to do a background check, it's gonna take a while, I don't think it's gonna work.'

""I started having conversations with these people and it was amazing to see how different the perspectives of the media were from the people themselves. They were telling me about their experiences in Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon.When another member of the immigration services realized I was speaking Arabic, she said she would let me volunteer. I ended up translating for chemo patients. Sometimes I'd walk the patients to a pharmacy outside to get their medications. 

""Right before I left, I got really close to one of the families, a family of six. The oldest is 15, the youngest is only one. By the time left the hotel, it was really hard to say goodbye. Fortunately, they have a phone and the Whatsapp application. We've been talking every day since then. So I go to school. I get home at night and I call them.

There's different little cafes, little nooks and crannies of that campus that no one goes to. Always ask, ""What can I do today?"" And they'll be like, ""See a show at Krannert."" Go. Take off running. While you're there, try it. No matter what. 

""Work is not life. That's not your purpose in this world. Your purpose in this life is to love each other and stay humble and stay kind. That's all that matters. Be a human being. That's your No. 1 goal. I get mad when people don't care about that. What do you love? Then go chase that.""

Tree Campus USA is a national program created in 2008 by the Arbor Day Foundation to acknowledge colleges and universities for successful campus forest management initiatives and for engaging staff and students in conservation goals. Currently, only 10% of four-year, degree-granting campuses nationally have achieved this prestigious certification.

#ILLINOIS achieved the title by meeting Tree Campus USA's five standards, which include maintaining a tree advisory committee, establishing a campus tree-care plan, dedicating annual stewardship for its campus tree program, performing an Arbor Day observance, and developing a student service-learning project.

Tara Zumwalt grew up in Iowa, and she always assumed she would attend Iowa State University like her mom. But when she started looking at various colleges around the country, she became interested in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the school her dad attended.

Her dad always talked about his great experiences at Illinois, but he never put any pressure on her to attend his beloved school.

While going through the college search process, Tara learned more about her family's Illinois history. If she decided to attend Illinois, she would be the fifth generation in her family to attend the school. That fact, combined with the strong engineering program and Marching Illini, led her to pick Illinois. She says it was a great decision.

""I absolutely love U. of I.,"" she said, ""and being the fifth generation was definitely part of my decision.

""Part of drawing class was nude drawing. She was across the room from me, and in between us was the nude model. He would have to change his position every 30 to 60 seconds or something and you would really have to sketch fast. All of a sudden his position change was him just reaching down and grabbing his ankles. And so his butt is facing me directly and I look up to continue to draw, and honestly, I couldn't keep it together. I looked across the room at Vanessa, our eyes met and we busted out laughing because it was so awkward and hilarious at the same time. 

""It wasn't all nude drawings ‚Ä¶ We went over to the greenhouses where CRCE is now and this is one of the first few times we had actually talked. We were doing charcoal drawing of the plants in the greenhouse. I said (to Vanessa), 'You have some charcoal on your face.' She went to the restroom and came back. She had put charcoal all over her face. She said, ""Did I get it?"" 

""Between drawing nude people and weird charcoal face incidents, we fell in love.""

""Referring to our conversation regarding squirrels, I think I shall be able to secure a few‚Ä¶that have been bred in the city and are not afraid of people.  I would suggest that a good sized breeding cage with several separate compartments be constructed somewhere on the lawn‚Ä¶and that several pairs be kept in it continuously‚Ä¶""

And we had to fill out all these financial aid forms. And I remember this. When we were filling out all these forms, our father was going through all this stuff and he said, ""I can't believe we have to do all this. You're just going to get married and never use this anyway. Do you really have to go to college?""

Patty: I don't remember him saying that.

Cathy: Well, he did. And so our mom and we turned on him and then he backed off pretty quickly. Which is funny because now we use our bachelor's stuff all the time. 

‚Ä¶In high school, we tried to make a more conscious effort to be different. And maybe a little more in college too, but once we weren't actually in the same town, I think we ended up converging, you know, to a potential energy minimum. Which means that we're not too different.

Patty: Now, we live four blocks away from each other‚Ä¶it's really great to have that family connection.

As we started to retire, we started to travel together. We went to Galena. Some of the group went to Hawaii. We had a get together last June in Florida. 

We've been through hard times. One of the guys had early dementia. One guy's daughter died of leukemia, and it was one of the saddest days of my life. Another friend died of cancer, and at his funeral his sister said this group was so meaningful to him.

We lived in this rather airy house down by the tracks, and it was just overridden by rats and mice. Every time we would kill one in a trap, we would paint its little picture on the door jamb. I moved on and was teaching in Wisconsin when the house was being demolished. Ed and Art preserved that door jamb, and Ed says he has it framed at home‚Äîand that's pretty adorable.

One difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.

""In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins,"" said Stephen Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. ""Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.""

As a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dagdeviren also developed a device that can be permanently implanted inside the body and harvest energy from the movements of organs. It can send that power directly to devices like pacemakers or be used to charge a battery. Today, pacemaker batteries are bulky and need to be surgically replaced every five to eight years.

Retroviruses, such as HIV, are tricky to treat. They go through a multistage process to produce infectious particles. The viruses that are released from infected cells are initially in an immature state and are composed of an RNA genome surrounded by a coat of protein. Upon their release, the viruses undergo a maturation process that rearranges the viral proteins and activates the conversion of the RNA genome into DNA through a process called reverse transcription. The viral DNA then invades the host cell's genome. The infected cell is programmed to release multiple copies of the immature virus into the host's bloodstream. These newly released viruses must in turn mature before they can infect other cells.

The group has already begun the process of studying the immature HIV virus on the Blue Waters supercomputer located at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications - NCSA at Illinois.","Beckman Researchers Construct Atomic Model of an Immature Retrovirus , News, Beckman Institute,...",link,http://beckman.illinois.edu/news/2015/08/immature-retrovirus-structure,2015-08-14 08:30:01,183,5,30,183,0,0,0,0,0

Professor Steve Levinson and his colleagues in the Language Acquisition and Robotics Lab at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology are particularly interested in getting Bert to interact with humans using spoken, natural language. 

The research revolves around the idea of embodied cognition. Unlike other forms of artificial intelligence, the models that Bert uses to understand the world aren't given to him by outside programmers. Instead, the iCub creates its mental models itself by directly interacting with the researchers and the world around it using its physical body. The researchers hope that, since Bert has a physical body similar to a human's, the mental models that it creates will be more like a human's as well.

After working as a medic and providing mobile clinical care to the less fortunate in Central America three years ago, I enjoyed it so much that I realized that others should have an opportunity like this. I recruited individuals with great moral character and experience in various healthcare fields and brought them on other trips. 

So far we have been able to provide free and accessible healthcare to over 6,000 people in Central America. It's greatly influenced my college experience - to really understand the human element and the human condition outside of the realm of the first world is truly humbling and has definitely influenced my career path and life.""

At the end of my sophomore year, I was turning in my final exam and my professor asked me what I was doing over the summer. I told him I wasn't sure yet. He said he ""had some connections"" and the next thing I know, I'm interning at Amazon for the summer. I'm excited to say that after graduation, I'm going to work for Amazon full time.

So, my first day on campus, my dad bought me an Oreo Blizzard. And I thought, 'Even if this doesn't go well, at least I got to try a Blizzard.'

Getting lost and being totally confused has been a big part of being here. I did a lot of going around and asking for directions from random people. Slowly, it's gotten better, and I figured out the bus system.  

Having a physical disability, you spend a lot of time with your parents, and you're dependent on them. They know everything you do because they drop you off and pick you up. It was nice to be at school and call my mom and tell her what I did that day. Or to decide that today I'm going to run errands, and I'm going to take myself there.

My first year as an RA, I had a resident who was depressed and, because of that, became suicidal. I didn't know about it until his roommate brought it to my attention. It opened my eyes to the stresses that academics can have on an individual. I am very proud to be an ally to someone going through that.

After that, I made sure I stayed in touch with my residents. It made me a lot more aware of certain issues students may deal with on campus. I've become a lot more willing to reach out to residents who are quiet and don't necessarily participate in activities. There can be underlying things that prevent them from being social.

I took Illinois and made it my own. I've never been satisfied with complacency. As a first-generation college student, I feel obligated to establish a standard. Simply making it here is not enough.

Next time you find yourself on the #ILLINOIS Quad, stop and check out the amazing detail on the exterior of Lincoln Hall at U of I!

Early designs called for a series of 3-foot by 9 1‚ÅÑ2-foot terra cotta panels adorning the front and sides of Lincoln Hall that depicted Abraham Lincoln's quotes and scenes from his lifetime. Calling it a ""labor of love,"" the American Terra Cotta and Ceramics Company of Chicago produced 10 scenic panels and 10 quote panels for $1,000 (10 more quote panels were added in the 1929 addition). For more details about the panels, go to www.lincolnhall.illinois.edu/renovation/features.

Ten scenic panels, mounted between the second and third floors facing the Quad, were designed by Kristian Schneider. The panels were meant to convey the spirit of Lincoln as the ""patient, conserving force of the man who stood strongly against public clamor for measures he believed to be right,"" according to an April 1912 article in The Clay-Worker that detailed the effort.

Along the north and south walls of Lincoln Hall, 10 original quote panels, each flanked by two medallion portraits of men who were important in Lincoln's life, were inscribed by 1911. The north side has portraits of Illinois leaders and the south side has national leaders. Ten more quote panels were added in 1929, but the portrait shields bracketing the quotes were left blank.",Photos from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/illinois.edu/photos/a.273265329904.141209.163536409904/10153152762659905/?type=3,2015-02-12 09:45:00,592,8,66,592,0,0,0,0,0

John Milton Gregory was the first regent of the Illinois Industrial University, serving from its founding in 1867. Gregory began his career as a graduate in law from Union College in Schenectady, New York, with academic standing near the head of his class. He then relocated to Michigan, where he was principal of a private academy and a member of the State Teachers' Association, founded the Michigan Journal of Education, served as president of Kalamazoo College and was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction. A member of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees heard him speak at a convention in Chicago and nominated him to become the first regent for the Illinois Industrial University.

At his request, Gregory was buried on campus. Along the path he walked each afternoon rests his gravestone, a simple bronze tablet attached to a boulder that had been on Illinois soil for centuries. His epitaph reads: ""If you seek his monument, look about you.""

Traffic counts, camera monitoring, and additional data gathering techniques will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the street enhancements through November. 

The crosswalk will feature new pavement markings, a painted median, a temporary ramp on the west side of the street, reflective traffic delineators, and barriers on the curb line to help direct pedestrians. Future options for the crosswalk, including becoming a permanent installation, will be determined based on impacts to safety, traffic congestion, pedestrian usage, and feedback from the campus community. 

The trial program is collaboration between F&S, College of Business, Campus Parking, and regional partners in the Champaign Urbana Urbanized Area Transportation Study (CUUATS). CUUATS is the transportation entity of the Champaign County Regional Planning Commission.

KwikBoost M8 charging tablet stations boast eight chargers per station, including 2 Apple Lighting, 2 Apple 30-Pin, 3 Micro USB and 1 Mini USB. The charging locker has eight lockers with two charging cables per locker for a total of sixteen connectors: 4 Apple Lighting, 4 Apple 30-Pin, 6 Micro USB and 2 Mini USB. Students will be able to lock up their devices in this unit utilizing the digital keypad locks with user-generated lock codes.  The charging stations guarantee to charge nearly 100% of mobile devices. The installation will provide students with current resources that match the demand for technology that is used both educationally and socially. 

Illini Union Director Lowa Mwilambwe commented on the development saying, ""We are excited to be partnering with the Illinois Student Senate on this project. ISS funded the purchase of the five pedestal-style charging stations. It is our goal at the Illini Union to listen to the students and respond accordingly to their feedback. As the request for charging stations became more frequent, we took action in order to provide the necessary amenities in today's rapidly evolving technological society.""

The Illini Union is located at 1401 W. Green St. in Urbana. The stations will also be garnished with Fighting Illini d√©cor to support the university spirit and morale.

Engineering at Illinois students, Patrick Walsh, Anish Thakkar and Mayank Sekhsaria launched Greenlight Planet to change that.

The Chicago-based company produces solar-powered lamps geared toward these rural communities. Since launching in 2009, the startup has sold 1.8 million lamps, which cost between $11 and $40, the equivalent of about two weeks wages in those communities. One million were sold in the last ten months alone.

""I have greatly appreciated the outpouring of public and private support from students, faculty, staff and alumni this week. But, at this point, I don't want to talk any more about a small number of ill-thought postings or bad behavior of a handful of individuals.

""What is really most important to me is that we, as a community, move beyond the personal aspects here of a single incident and focus our conversations and efforts on addressing the larger issues that have been raised. This is a chance for us to talk about how we go about ensuring our campus environment is one that encourages diverse opinion and fair debate and is a place where great ideas flourish.""

Soon after purchasing something, there is a reduction of anxiety. But it doesn't last very long. It's fleeting. Materialists seek that as one of their coping mechanisms. And Black Friday and the holiday shopping season play into that.""

Ground was broken for the Armory Building on the #ILLINOIS campus‚Äîwhich was conceived as a location for housing cadet military training‚Äîon September 18, 1912. The building, designed by Illinois state architect William Carbys Zimmerman, was officially dedicated on November 1, 1914, reportedly with 15,000 people in attendance. When construction was finished, the building was considered the largest structure in the world without a center support. The 98-foot-high ceiling suspended over 80,000 square feet of floor space‚Äîincluding the track in the center of the building‚Äîis supported by three-hinged arches weighing 36 tons each

Today, the Armory Building has many functions. It houses the offices of several University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign departments and units, including the ACDIS program and three military science/Reserve Officer Training Corps programs (Army ROTC, Air Force ROTC, Marine Corps and Navy ROTC). Numerous academic courses are held each semester in the Armory's classrooms.

The current record of 5,868 pounds was prepared by Asociaci√≥n de Productores del Tomates de Los Palacios (Spain). The goal for the #UofI is 7,500 pounds.

The preparation of 7,000 pounds of tomatoes, 600 pounds of onions, 20 pounds of jalape√±o peppers, 375 bunches of cilantro, and 70 gallons of lime juice will begin at 5 a.m. The completed salsa will be assembled in front of students in Memorial Stadium directly following New Student Convocation.

The salsa will feature local produce, including vegetables and herbs from the on-campus Sustainable Student Farm @ The University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.

A representative from Guinness World Records will be on hand to certify the results. If the salsa is a record-breaker, Guinness will present a certificate to the University on the spot. After certification by Guinness, the salsa will be served at dinner on Saturday in University Housing's dining halls.

The handheld biosensor was developed by researchers at the Illinois. A series of lenses and filters in the cradle mirror those found in larger, more expensive laboratory devices. Together, the cradle and app transform a smartphone into a tool that can detect toxins and bacteria, spot water contamination and identify allergens in food.

Kenny Long, a graduate researcher at Illinois, says the team was able to make the smartphone even smarter with modifications to the cellphone camera.

Should the The Library of Congress be compiling a list of the most influential software of all time, just as it does annually for the National Film Registry and the National Recording Registry? This idea was raised at a recent meeting the Library sponsored on the long-term preservation of computer software for its cultural and historical significance. How to even begin? Restrict it to applications only, no operating systems? Home computers only? What about industrial and enterprise software? What about the software in your car or on a 777? What about software that comes to you nowadays as a service, like YouTube and Twitter? What about mobile apps?

#8 - IBM Lotus Notes, created by ILLINOIS alumni Raymond ""Ray"" Ozzie '79. Lotus was social media before its time, this client-server package included chat, blogging, micro-blogging, and forums as well as email, calendars, to-do lists, and lots more that we'd nowadays recognize as lifehacking. Not the sexiest pick for this list perhaps, but we couldn't imagine computers without all the things Lotus Notes did.

# 9 - #Mosaic was transitional software, the stepping stone between the text-only Lynx , which was how the World-Wide Web was originally conceived and accessed, and #NetscapeNavigator, which would dominate the browser market in the Web's early public years. But between them came Mosaic, the software famously written by a ILLINOIS undergraduate Marc Andreessen '94. Mosaic was the first graphical Web browser. Suddenly all the links were blue, suddenly every home page had a GIF cat.

The mystery of why some animals can regenerate body parts while others cannot has long puzzled scientists, but three new studies have brought the issue to a head. 

""The idea that interfering with a single gene could overcome the blockage of head regeneration was a big surprise,"" said Phillip Newmark, a developmental biologist at the University of Illinois and leader of one of the other studies.

Knocking out a single gene can switch on a worm's ability to regenerate parts of its body, even enabling it to grow a new head. The fact that such a simple manipulation can restore healing abilities provides new insight into how the stem cells involved in this process are marshalled in animals.

Please know that we had the best of intentions and our team does amazing work. This feature was never meant to replace Alma. It is cool, because you can walk around the sculpture and see her new look in 3D. The rendering on an iPhone isn't able to capture the detail that the image shows. 

We have created several other Alma options that I hope you'll try. Thursday and Friday (10a - 4p), you can also go to the north lounge of the Union and get a photo booth picture with Classic Alma. Friday, Saturday and Sunday (weather permitting), we'll have six-foot tall plaster Almas at Beckman, one the Quad, at the Alice Campbell Alunni Center, at Art & Design and at the Assembly Hall. The 1867 Society will have strolling Almas around campus who will pose for pix with you, and we'll have a green screen at GradFest Sunday from 11a-2p with a very realistic background featuring classic Alma.

After weeks of close match-ups and thousands of votes, you have selected the transistor as the winner! The Transistor was co-invented by John Bardeen who joined the Illinois faculty in 1951. In addition to the transistor, Bardeen also co-developed the BCS Theory of Superconductivity, which made it to our round of 16!

Bardeen was named by Life Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. He is also the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in Physics (1956 and 1972).
