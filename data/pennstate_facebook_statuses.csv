While we don't know who the young woman is in the photo, after featuring it in Thursday's Penn State Today, we heard from 1976 mechanical engineering grad Todd Figard, who built the snowman with Ray Trunzo: 

""Ray 'Hoagie' Trunzo (BS '76/MS Aerospace Eng) and I built Snoopy on the railing the evening prior to this photo while on the way back to Hamilton Hall from an excursion downtown. It was a wet snow perfect for snowman building and one thing led to another and Snoopy was the end result of about 3 hours effort. To keep him from falling over, we used a broken safety barrier to form his spine with the V-shaped legs supporting his upper arms. His ears wear a pair of old socks with his eyes a split squashball. We found an old shirt for the scarf and used a twig to help keep it extended like he was actually flying. His nose would up being dyed with black ink because all of my racketballs were blue or green.

The Wyomissing Polytechnic Institute, housed in an old church, closed in 1958 and gave its building to Penn State for an extension center. By 1972 it moved to its current 106-acre site in Spring Township and became the Penn State Berks campus. Today, it enrolls more than 2,800 students and offers 19 baccalaureate degrees.

Though never officially adopted as a Penn State symbol, Coaly was held in high esteem. Brought to campus from Kentucky by Lytle in 1857, Coaly helped in construction of Old Main, hauling limestone blocks.  He had an extraordinary capacity for work, and for 30 years handled many landscaping and farm chores around campus. 

Coaly was so beloved that after his death in 1893, his skeleton was preserved as a relic of Penn State's past. It's now on display in the HUB-Robeson Center.

This is the very first photo known to have been taken of the Nittany Lion at a football game-- Penn State vs. Syracuse at New York's Polo Grounds on Oct. 28, 1922.

The ""man in the suit"" that day was Richard Hoffman '23, who was chosen at least partly because he played a lion in a Penn State Players' production of Androcles and the Lion. Hoffman, who later became a physician, recalled ""it was hotter than the Mojave inside that lion suit."" Not until the class of 1940 presented the gift of the Nittany Lion shrine in 1942 was the lion firmly established as a mountain lion.

146381745267_10152765043240268,"Flashback Friday!

Beginning in 1914, the May Pole dance became a Penn State tradition.

At that time, male students outnumbered females by 2,251 to 80 -- and those 80 were determined to be the fairest of them all.

May Day was a medieval festival that observed the coming of spring with merrymaking. The first May Queen was Mildred Ride Dunlap ('14). She and her Grecian-clad nymphs danced and intertwined long satin ribbons around a May Pole. The Cadet Band played, the public was invited, and proceeds went to the College Hospital Fund.

Over the years, the festival became more elaborate. Our photo shows the way participants looked in 1925.

After World War II, the celebration seemed frivolous and expensive, and the event ended in 1959.

Penn State's first president, Evan Pugh, was a newlywed of only a few months when he died on this week in April 1864. 

He and Rebecca Valentine, the daughter of a prominent Bellefonte family, were married that February. Pugh, already weakened from a carriage accident the previous year and physically and mentally overworked, succumbed to typhoid twelve weeks later. 

Although she had other suitors, notably James A. Beaver, who later played an influential role in Penn State's history, Rebecca never remarried and resided in Bellefonte until her death in 1921. Evan and Rebecca are buried in Bellefonte's Union Cemetery.

April is National Poetry Month. 

Renowned poet Theodore Roethke began teaching at Penn State in 1936. In 1941, he published his first book, ""Open House."" He donated the manuscript and galley proof of that collection to the library.

In 1939, Roethke became Penn State's varsity tennis coach. He's shown here with one of his teams. (Roethke is at left in the second row.)

Roethke's squads compiled an overall record of 29 wins to 21 losses from 1939 to 1943.

Roethke left Penn State for a position at the University of Washington in the mid 1940s. In 1954, he won the Pulitzer prize for poetry.

It looks much as it may have when Moses Thompson and his family moved here in 1842, adjacent to his Centre Furnace iron works. Thompson and his wife, Mary Irvin Thompson, resided at the mansion for 49 years and hosted many social and business gatherings for Penn State trustees, administrators, faculty and guests.

Thompson and James Irvin -- Thompson's business partner, fellow ironmaster, and brother-in-law -- were instrumental in selecting the site of the campus for Penn State, soon after the new college's chartering in 1855, and Irvin made the initial donation of 200 acres of land. 

The mansion, located at the corner of Porter Road and College Avenue, is now home to the Centre County Historical Society.

It's the Ghost Walk -- named for a legend about a student who got lost and froze to death during a blizzard in the 1860s.

The path between two rows of Norway spruce and Austrian pine trees ran from behind Old Botany approximately where Burrowes Building now stands.

Horticulture Professor William Waring planted the grove in the 1860s. Because of its seclusion, it became a meeting place for students and a popular lovers' lane.

But those aren't real ghosts in the photo. They're a group of girls including the daughters of Professor William Buckhout, who made the double-exposure photo in the 1890s.

In 1929 many of the trees were removed due to deterioration and only one -- a Norway Spruce -- remains standing today.

Not quite. This photo probably dates from the late 1890s, when the band uniforms were brown.  

In 1899, steel magnate and Penn State Trustee Andrew Carnegie gave a donation to purchase instruments for a newly formed Cadet Band, which superseded a fife-and-drum corps. This photo shows a fife and drum unit with buglers, perhaps transitioning toward the Cadet Band, which had more brass. 

Within a few years, the Cadet Band was playing at football games, dances in the Armory, and similar campus and community functions and by 1913 was re-named the College Band.

Welcome to the Devil's Den, one of several temporary wood-frame residence halls hastily built in time to house some of the incoming students in the fall of 1904. It could house about 50 students. It was located about where Electrical Engineering East building stands today. This view looks toward Pollock Road (which runs behind Devil's Den). At far right you can see the newly completed Carnegie Building along with part of another temporary dorm, Bright Angel. No idea how they got their names. They were demolished soon after completion of new permanent student housing, McAllister Hall, in 1905.

Unsurprisingly, the 1926 Pajama Parade brought an end to the tradition.

Some tips from Penn State Hershey Medical Center:

-- Generously apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen, with SPF of 30 or more, to all exposed skin. Broad-spectrum provides protection from both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. Re-apply approximately every two hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.

-- Wear protective clothing such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, when possible.

-- Seek shade when appropriate, keeping in mind that the sun's rays are strongest from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. A good rule of thumb is that you should seek shade if your shadow is shorter than you.

-- Protect children from sun exposure by encouraging them to play in the shade, and dress them in protective clothing and apply sunscreen often.

-- Use extra caution near water, snow and sand, as they reflect the damaging rays of the sun and can cause sunburn.

-- Get vitamin D safely through a healthy diet that may include vitamin supplements.

-- Avoid tanning beds. Ultraviolet light from the sun and tanning beds can cause skin cancer and wrinkling. As an alternative, use a sunless self-tanning product and continue to use sunscreen with it.

-- Perform regular self-exams. If you notice anything changing, growing or bleeding on your skin, see a dermatologist. Skin cancer is very treatable when detected early enough.",,status,,2012-06-20 11:46:32,24,3,9,24,0,0,0,0,0
